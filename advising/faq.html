<p><b>Q: What about the Computer Science Requirements page on Willamette.edu (<a href="https://willamette.edu/undergraduate/computer-science/info/requirements/index.html">link</a>)?</b>

<p>A: That page is slightly out-of-date. Some courses are renumbered:<p>
<ol>
  <li>CS 151 is unaltered. This course is titled Intro to Programming in Python.
  <li>MATH 251W is unaltered. This course is titled Foundations of Advanced Mathematics.
  <li>CS 241 is now CS 152. This course is titled Data Structures.
  <li>CS 260 is now CS 261. This course is titled Software Development.
  <li>CS 343 is now CS 351. This course is titled Analysis of Algorithms.
</ol>
Students enrolled at Willamette prior to August 2022 may graduate under those requirements. For new students, there are two new requirements:
<ol>
  <li>CS 271: Networks and Systems
  <li>DATA 352W: Ethics, Teamwork, Communications
</ol>
There is also a slight change to elective requirements:
<ol>
  <li>Rather than requiring two (2) 100-level and three (3) 300-level electives, three (3) electives of any level are required.
  <li>In addition to any CS elective or an approved elective, any DATA elective may be counted toward the CS major.
</ol>

<p><b>Q: What about the Data Science Requirements page on Willamette.edu (<a href="https://willamette.edu/undergraduate/data-science/info/requirements/index.html">link</a>)?</b>

<p>A: There is not a one-to-one equivalence with courses listed on that page and courses currently offered by Data & Computing programs at Willamette. Students enrolled at Willamette prior to August 2022 may graduate under those requirements. Students who partially completed that degree program will receive credit under the new requirements as follows:<p>
<ol>
  <li>CS 151 is unaltered. This course is titled Intro to Programming in Python.
  <li>MATH 280 is unaltered. This course is titled Math for Data Science.
  <li>MATH 239 gives credit for DATA 151.
  <li>MATH 138, IDS 138, or AP Stat gives credit for DATA 151.
  <li>CS 475 gives credit for DATA 252.
  <li>DATA 403 gives credit for DATA 351.
  <li>CS 370 gives elective credit.
</ol>

<p><b>Q: What is the latest a student can begin a CS or DS major to graduate on time?</b>

<p>A: Either major may be completed in four semesters. Assuming a 4 year graduate timeline, this means the major can be started in the first semester of the third year.

<p><b>Q: This page lists a CS/DS double major. Why was this double major chosen?</b>

<p>A: Yes! We have many double (or more!) majors. This page only lists the CS/DS double because I am a faculty advisor for these two majors. I hope to develop advising materials for other double majors soon!

<p><b>Q: Who do I ask about remaining questions</b>

<p>A: Email me: <a href="mailto:ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu">ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu</a>
