<h2>Announcements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to IDS-101-13: Thinking Machines!</li>
<li>There was no summer homework.<ul>
<li>Shouvik says I can't say it's because I forgot to make one because that will make a bad first impression.
<li>Suffice to say: It was because of circumstances beyond Shouvik's control.</ul>
<li>Things to do:
<ul>
<li>Access the course webpage at <a href="https://cd-public.github.io/courses/ccf24/">here!</a>
<ul>
<li>There is also a link to the course webpage from the Canvas site</li>
<li>Probably searching something close to my name will get you there.
</ul></li>
<li>Join the class Discord server for ease of communication and
announcements<ul>
<li>I will email you a link!</li>
</ul>
<li>Bring computer to class from now on.
<ul><li>Let me know if you need one; I'll figure something out</li>
</ul></li>

<dt>Thesis Title</dt>
<dd>Mining Secure Behavior of Hardware Designs
</dd>
<dt>Plain English</dt>
<dd>Just as there are bugs in code that makes <b>software</b>, modern <b>hardware</b> is also written in code and therefore may contain bugs. I find these bugs.
</dd>
<dt>Thesis</dt>
<dd>Specification mining can discover properties that can be used to verify the secure
behavior of closed source CISC CPU designs, properties that can be used to verify
the temporal correctness of CPU designs, and hyperproperties that can be used to
verify that modules, SoCs, and CPUs have secure information flow.

<h2>Background</h2>
<dl>
<dt>My subject:</dt>
<dd>I study <b>physical devices</b> that either think, or do something an awful lot like thinking.
</dd>
<dt>My technique:</dt>
<dd>I use <b>code</b> that is ran *on the devices I study* to measure how these devices think... or whatever they do instead of thinking.

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artifical intelligence, machine learning, big data, and large scale computing have captured the collective imaginations of millions people across a range of technical expertise.<ul>
<li>Yet each of these buzzwords is rooted in a central promise: that machines may think. 
</ul>
<li>Guided by student inquiry, we will learn how to construct thinking - or the appearance thereof - from basic computation. 
<ul>
<li>Using the shared language of computer code, we use programming as a way to bridge the gap between thinking humans and thinking machines.</li>
<li>With this shared experience, we will be able to reflect more thoughtfully on the implications of thinking machines on the self, culture, and society. 
</ul>

<h2>student inquiry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let’s start the class off right away with an exercise designed for:<ul>
<li>Groups
<li>Discussion
<li>Disagreement, and
<li>Deep critical thinking
</ul>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<ul >
<li><b>Try!</b> You will have to try very hard to work through this material. Trying is exactly what we’re after since it is ultimately what leads to innovative thinking.
<li><b>Fail!</b> More accurately, don’t be afraid to fail. You should write code, work problems, and form opinions then be completely unafraid to scrap what you’ve done and redo it from scratch.
<li><b>Collaborate!</b> You should collaborate with your peers with the following caveat:<ul><li>
        Make sure to take the time you need to understand material yourself!<li>We learn best when we all learn together!</ul>
<li><b>Enjoy!</b> Part of the fun is that you get to experience what it is like being a scientist. It takes hard work but ultimately this should be fun!
