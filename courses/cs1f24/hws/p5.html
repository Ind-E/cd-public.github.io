                            <p>Because large projects like this one typically involve more than one programmer, you are encouraged to work on this project in teams of two, although you are free to work individually as well. Each person in a two-person team will receive the same grade.
                            <p>To allow for the possibility of partners, everyone will need to make a team when accepting the assignment, even if you are just going to be working on things solo. Once one partner has made the team, the other can join it. If you accidentally join a team you did not mean to, let Professor Rembold know, and they can see about getting you removed so that you can join another. Only join an existing team if you intend to work with that person! It can help if you name your teams based on the expected team member’s names.
                            <p>While most pairs will likely want to work on the code together, in person, there are good resources at your disposal that can help should you would want to work more remotely. If you work in a pair, you will both have access to a shared repository on GitHub. This means that, as long as you are good about uploading your files, each person can usually work on the latest version of the code without too much issue. 
                            <p>There are some built in ways within VSCode that you can sync your local files with GitHub files as well. VSCode also has a remote sharing extension, which can essentially give you collaborative control over your code, similar to Google docs. The extension is called “Live Share” if you want to search for it within the VSCode extensions.
                            <p><strong>In general, you should check in code frequently when working with partners.</strong>

                            <blockquote>Modify TMCourse and TMQuestion to make AdvGame and AdvRoom</blockquote>
                            <p>Of the initial 4 Python files for Adventure, most of the work is incomplete. For this milestone, you will make changes to <code>AdvGame.py</code> and <code>AdvRoom.py</code>.
                            <p>The code provide for the Teaching Machine is complete and can be used as a template. To get started on Adventure, I recommend doing the following:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Within <code>TMCourse.py</code> and <code>TMQuestion.py</code>:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Convert all mentions of "TM" to "Adv"
                                    <li>I replaced both Capitalized and lowercase terms for:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>"course" to "game"
                                        <li>"question" to "room"
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Convert all mentions of "answer" to "passage".
                                    <li>Convert all mentions of "text" to "long_description".
                                    <li>I use "ctrl+h" or "cmd+h" to find and replace these mentions.
                                </ul>
                                <li>I moved the following methods and functions directly from the TM files to the Adv files
                                <ul>
                                    <li>From <code>TMCourse</code> to <code>AdvGame</code>:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>run</code>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>From <code>TMQuestion</code> to <code>AdvRoom</code>:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>get_name</code>
                                        <li><code>get_passages</code>
                                        <li><code>read_room</code>
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                                <li>For <code>AdvRoom</code>, I updated the code to support short descriptions:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I updated <code>__init__</code> to set <code>self._short_description</code>
                                    <li>I wrote the getter methods for <code>short_description</code>
                                    <li>I modified the <code>read_room</code> function at the bottom of <code>AdvRoom</code> to provide the argument <code>text</code> twice - once as a short description and once as a long description - so that the <code>__init__</code> method would have the correct number of arguments.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We will deal with short and long descriptions in the next milestone.
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                                <li>I added <code>read_room</code> to the import statement at the beginning of the file with <code>AdvGame</code> - initially the import statement only imports <code>AdvRoom</code>.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Teaching Machine imported first <code>read_course</code> and now <code>read_room</code>, and we will need to use <code>read_room</code>.
                                </ul>
                                <li>I took the code from the <code>TMCourse</code> file function <code>read_game</code> (formerly "read course") and placed it within in the <code>__init__</code> method of <code>AdvGame</code>.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I had to increase the identation level by one.
                                    <li>I had to remove the return statement.
                                    <li>In lieu of the return statement, I:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Created a new attribute, <code>self._rooms</code>
                                        <li>Set it equal to dictionary <code>rooms</code>
                                        <li>Updated the <code>get_room</code> getter method.
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                                <li>I modified the <code>__init__</code> method to work with a string that is a prefix to a file name, rather than with a Python file object:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In Teaching Machine, a file is opened in <code>TeachingMachine.py</code> and <code>read_course</code> is called with this file as an argument - this is the <code>f</code> referred to in the code, such as in the following line:
                                    <hr><code>room = read_room(f)</code><hr>
                                    <li>In <code>Adventure.py</code>, no such file is opened and instead <code>AdvGame</code> is given a <code>DATA_FILE_PREFIX</code> which is initially set to <code>"Tiny"</code>
                                    <hr><code>DATA_FILE_PREFIX = "Tiny"</code><hr>
                                    <li>This prefix is sole argument to the <code>AdvGame.__init__</code> method, shown here:
                                    <hr><code>game = AdvGame(DATA_FILE_PREFIX)</code><hr>
                                    <li>So, I took the following code from <code>TeachingMachine.py</code>:
                                    <hr><code>with open(filename + ".txt") as f:</code><hr>
                                    <li>And modified it for AdvGame.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>I changed <code>"filename"</code> to <code>"prefix"</code>
                                        <li>I changed <code>".txt"</code> to <code>"Rooms.txt"</code>, the Adventure game specific suffix for rooms files
                                        <li>I placed this <code>with</code> statement in the line immediately prior to <code>room = read_room(f)</code>, which I indented under this statement, and left other lines at their original indentation level.
                                        <hr><pre><code>while not finished:
    with open(prefix + "Rooms.txt") as f:
        room = read_room(f)
    if room is None:</code></pre><hr>
                            <li>I ran <code>Adventure.py</code> and verified I was able to see text prompts.
                            </ol>
                            <p>When you see following when running <code>Adventure.py</code> and providing first "west" then "east" as inputs, you are ready to move on to Milestone 1.
                            <hr><pre><code>Outside building

                                    </ul>
                                    <li>If not, print the long description.

                                        <li>There is existing code to print the long description, which is a list of strings.
                                        <li>You are welcome to find other ways to store the long description, most likely in <code>read_room</code>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>I implement this all as a "print_text" method in <code>AdvRoom</code>, but you may do whatever you like!

                            <p>So far, anything typed into Adventure corresponded to a passage which led to another room. For this milestone, we will check to see if the typed text is "QUIT", "HELP", or "LOOK" and print accordingly.
                            <ul>
                                <li>In response to "QUIT", run Python <code>quit()</code> which will cause Python to stop running.
                                <li>In response to "HELP", run <code>print(HELP_TEXT)</code>
                                <li>In response to "LOOK", print the long description of the current room.
                            </ul>
                            <p>The most obvious place I found to place this code was in <code>AdvGame.run</code>. I used an <code>if</code> statement to see if the <code>response</code> was a room or a command.
                            <p>Because the description of a room is only printed when the room changes, I had to make a few changes to how <code>AdvGame.run</code> worked in general. Basically, check to see if the room has changed before before printing the room description.
                            <p>I dealt with commands much the way I dealt with buttons in ImageShop - each named command had a corresponding function. I wrote these in <code>AdvGame</code>.
                            <p>When you see following when running <code>Adventure.py</code> and providing first "west" then "east" then "west" as inputs, you are ready to move on to Milestone 3:

                            <h4>3a: <code>read_item</code> in <code>AdvItem.py</code></h4>
                            <p>Write the function <code>read_item</code> based on your code for <code>read_room</code>. I should note, I found this considerably easier than reading rooms. In all cases there is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A line containing an item name in all caps
                                <li>A line containing a item description
                                <li>A line containing an initial location of the item that is either the name of a room or <code>"PLAYER"</code>
                                <li>A blank line
                            </ul>
                            <p>My <code>read_item</code> either returned <code>None</code> after reading all items or an <code>AdvItem</code> object in the final line...
                            <h4>3b: <code>AdvItem</code> class in <code>AdvItem.py</code></h4>
                            <p>I implemented the following methods of the <code>AdvItem</code> class:
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>__init__</code>
                                <li><code>__repr__</code>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You may also want to implement a getter method to find the initial location.
                            <p>In <code>__repr__</code>, I simply returned the value of the description so that I was able to call <code>print()</code> on <code>AdvItem</code> instances directly, which I found easier than using a <code>AdvItem.get_description()</code> method and printing the returned string.
                            <p>When you think your <code>AdvItem</code> methods and <code>read_object</code> function are ready, you can test them while adding objects to rooms.
                            <h4>3c: <code>AdvRooms.items</code> attribute in <code>AdvRoom.py</code></h4>
                            <p>I added a single attribute to the <code>AdvRoom</code> class to track what items are in a room.
                            <p>I used a dictionary, where keys were the names and the values were the AdvItem objects.
                            <hr><code>self.items = {}</code><hr>
                            <p>You will need to be able to add, remove, and check for the presence of any item in a room, which naturally corresponds to three dictionary operations and three methods of the <code>AdvRoom</code> class.
                            <h4>3d: Read items from the appropriate file within <code>AdvGame.__init__</code></h4>
                            <p>I stored the items within the appropriate room. There is one special case, where the item is attached to the <code>PLAYER</code>, which we ignore for this milestone.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Open the items file:
                                <hr><code>with open(prefix + "Items.txt") as f:</code><hr>
                                <li>Read items for the file
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For each item, find the corresponding initial location.
                                    <li>Add that item to the set of items within that location.
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>3e: Print descriptions of items when entering rooms.</h4>
                            <p>Update <code>AdvGame.run</code> to print all items in a room. This should be formatted as the string <code>"There is a"</code> followed by the description of the item (as a string) followed by the string <code>"here."</code>.
                            <p>You are ready to move onto the next milestone when the set of keys is reported upon entering the relevant room, as seen below:
                            <hr><pre><code>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
building.  A small stream flows out of the building and   
down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill   
to the west.

                            <blockquote>Item Commands</blockquote>
                            <p>You previously implemented "QUIT", "HELP", and "LOOK", likely as a series of statements calling helper functions, like "look_action". For this milestone, you will add three new commands: "TAKE", "DROP", and "INVENTORY".
                            <h4>4a: Two-part commands</h4>
                            <p>Each of "TAKE" and "DROP" are special commands that require an additional argument:
                            <hr><pre><code>You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
The exit door is to the south.
There is a set of keys here.
> take keys
Taken.
></code></pre><hr>
                            <p>The easiest way I found to work with these multi-word commands was with the string method ".split" which works as follows:
                            <hr><pre><code>>>> ex = "take keys"
> ex.split()
['take', 'keys']</code></pre><hr>
                            <p>That is, by using the split method of a string, you will get a list of words. It also works on strings with no spaces, and simply returns a list of length one. I had a simple "if" statement to manage the case where there was an additional argument and I am dealing with a "TAKE" or "DROP".
                            <h4>4b: AdvGame.inventory</h4>
                            <p>In Milestone 2, we ignored the case of items that are held by the player. Add an attribute to AdvGame to keep track of the items the player is currently holding. I used a dictionary named <code>inv</code>, for "inventory".
                            <p>You will need to update "read_item" to deal with the case where the initial location of an item is <code>"PLAYER"</code>.
                            <h4>4c: TAKE <em>item</em></h4>
                            <p>TAKE checks the current room to see if <em>item</em> is present. If so, the item is (1) removed from the room and (2) added to the inventory you created in 4b. If an item is taken, the game should acknowledge that by printing the text <code>"Taken"</code>.
                            <h4>4d: DROP <em>item</em></h4>
                            <p>DROP checks the current room to see if <em>item</em> is present. If so, the item is (1) removed from the room and (2) added to the inventory you created in 4b. If an item is taken, the game should acknowledge that by printing the text <code>"Dropped"</code>.
                            <p>My code for "TAKE" and "DROP" was virtually identical, and it would be possible to write and helper function that does both, though not necessarily easier depending on your other design decisions.
                            <h4>4e: INVENTORY</h4>
                            <p>This command will list the items in the players inventory, which was implemented in 4b.
                            <ul>
                                <li>If there is nothing in inventory:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Print <code>"You are empty-handed."</code>
                                </ul>
                                <li>If there is at least one item in the inventory:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Print <code>"You are carrying:</code> on one line.
                                    <li>For each item, print one line:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Print two (2) spaces <code>"  "</code>
                                        <li>Print the description 
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Like <code>"a set of keys"</code>
                                            <li>Do not print the name, like <code>"KEYS"</code>
                                        </ul>
                                    </ul>

                            <p>The file with the <code>Synonyms.txt</code> ending contains a series of lines:
                            <hr><pre><code>N=NORTH
S=SOUTH
...</code></pre><hr>
                            <p>In each case there is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A "synonym": one of more letters that is not a current command
                                <li>An equals sign "<code>=</code>"
                                <li>An existing command or item name,
                            </ul>
                            <h4>5a: Read a Synonyms file</h4>
                            <p>Either with in <code>AdvGame.__init__</code>, or more likely within a <code>read_syns</code> function called from <code>AdvGame.__init__</code>, read each line from the appropriate file and populate a dictionary where keys are synonyms and values are commands.
                            <p>You have sample code from <code>read_item</code> to read and process lines of text.
                            <p>I highly recommend the use of ".split()" again, but this time with the argument <code>"="</code> in order to split on equals-sign instead of the default spaces.Here is an example:
                            <hr><pre><code>>>> ex = "N=NORTH"
>>> ex.split("=")
['N', 'NORTH']
>>></code></pre><hr>
                            <p>Create a dictionary in <code>AdvGame</code> that contains all the synonyms as keys and the commands/items as values.
                            <h4>5b: Update <code>run</code></h4>
                            <p>Use synonyms in <code>AdvGame.run</code>
                            <p>After reading in a response and possibly breaking it into two, instead of one, words, we use synonyms.
                            <p>Check each input word, and if it is in the synonyms dictionary, update the response to include the command/item name instead.
                            <p>This was hard for me to explain - here is an example:
                            <hr><pre><code>>>> word = "N"
>>> if word in syns:
...     word = syns[word]
... 
>>> word
'NORTH'</code></pre><hr>
                            <p>Here is an extended example that uses both command ("release" and "i") and item ("bottle") synonyms:
                            <hr><pre><code>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
building.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill
to the west.
> release bottle
Dropped.
> i

                            <p>The file with the <code>Synonyms.txt</code> ending contains a series of lines:
                            <hr><pre><code>N=NORTH
S=SOUTH
...</code></pre><hr>
                            <p>In each case there is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A "synonym": one of more letters that is not an existing command or item
                                <li>An equals sign "<code>=</code>"
                                <li>An existing command or item
                            </ul>
                            <h4>5a: Read a Synonyms file</h4>
                            <p>Either with in <code>AdvGame.__init__</code>, or more likely within a <code>read_syns</code> function called from <code>AdvGame.__init__</code>, read each line from the appropriate file and populate a dictionary where keys are synonyms and values are commands.
                            <p>You have sample code from <code>read_item</code> to read and process lines of text.
                            <p>I highly recommend the use of ".split()" again, but this time with the argument <code>"="</code> in order to split on equals-sign instead of the default spaces.Here is an example:
                            <hr><pre><code>>>> ex = "N=NORTH"
>>> ex.split("=")
['N', 'NORTH']
>>></code></pre><hr>
                            <p>Create a dictionary in <code>AdvGame</code> that contains all the synonyms as keys and the commands/items as values.
                            <h4>5b: Update <code>run</code></h4>
                            <p>Use synonyms in <code>AdvGame.run</code>
                            <p>After reading in a response and possibly breaking it into two, instead of one, words, we use synonyms.
                            <p>Check each input word, and if it is in the synonyms dictionary, update the response to include the command/item name instead.
                            <p>This was hard for me to explain - here is an example:
                            <hr><pre><code>>>> word = "N"
>>> if word in syns:
...     word = syns[word]
... 
>>> word
'NORTH'</code></pre><hr>
                            <p>Here is an extended example that uses both command ("release" and "i") and item ("bottle") synonyms:
                            <hr><pre><code>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
building.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill
to the west.
> release bottle
Dropped.
> i
