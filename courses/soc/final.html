<h3>Due Date</h3>

<p>No extensions possible.

<h3>Preamble</h3>

Below is a recommended final assignment of a draft grant proposal. It is recommended by the Faculty Director of the First Year Experience. In total, this assignment will be seven pages - one for this course, six for the university.

In accordance with our discussions in this course, your assignment for this class will include an additional one page cover letter, for which the colloquium instructor is the target audience, that describes how your proposal challenges rather than upholds existing power dynamics, drawing on lines of analysis we formulated as a class throughout this semester.

Some ideas may include:
<ol>
<li>Investigate the political factions in Portland that ended the desegregation bussing program in the 1980s and where they are today. <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2014/05/brown_v_board_of_education_60t.html">Read more.</a>
<li>Contextualize the state of faculty and staff unionization at Willamette University with other institutions of higher education in Oregon. <a href="<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2014/05/brown_v_board_of_education_60t.html">Read more.</a>
<li>Develop an appendix to Settlers that corrects references to the "Iroqouis League" to use the preferred term, Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and provides supporting evidence citing Haudenosaunee materials.  <a href="<a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/who-we-are/">Read more.</a>
</ol>

That is, in total, you must submit:

<ul>
<li>A one page cover letter.
<li>A six page grant proposal.
</ul>

Submissions are formatting are the same as for the midterm.

What follows is text directly from the Director that specifies the six page grant proposal. It is unaltered save formatting to html.

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>College Colloquium Student Research Grants offer Willamette undergraduates the opportunity to undertake a scholarly, creative, or professional research project during the summer between their first and second years. Approximately four grants of up to $3,500 are available each year. Students may apply for these competitive grants only as first-year students. Projects must be related to the subject of the applicant's College Colloquium. Normally the colloquium instructor serves as the principal advisor. Projects may be creative and artistic, literary, investigative, interdisciplinary, and/or performative. Past Colloquium grant recipients have, among other things:

<ol>
<li>made documentary films about Rwanda's efforts to recover from genocide, 
<li>knitting in Scotland, 
<li>a sail race to Alaska;
<li>taught photography to children in South Africa as part of an exploration of art as a political force;
<li>developed an environmental curriculum for area high school students focused on local resource use issues;
<li>examined Virginia Woolf's treatment of relationships through a close reading of novels including To the Lighthouse and Mrs. Dalloway;
<li>investigated weighted pebbling numbers of graphs and theorems concerning them
<li>translated and illustrated a classic Chinese fairy tale;
<li>written a comparative study of Spanish artists engaged in psychodynamic art;
<li>presented a staged reading of a controversial Caryl Churchill play and studied audience reaction;
<li>made a close study of the grantee’s indigenous [sic] heritage through interviews, archival work, and/or community involvement;
<li>analyzed the debates over Female Genital Cutting as a discourse about cultural sensitivity;
<li>studied “The Humanitarian Crisis at the U.S.-Mexico Border and COVID-19”;
<li>viewed and analyzed Holocaust memorials;
<li>designed and refined a game: “A Journey of Playtesting, Illustration, and Game Publishing”
<li>documented isolation and debris at Japanese American Internment Camps.
</ol>
