    <h2>C Bad</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Okay we can agree this is awful right.
	<code>char buf[20];
fcntl(0, F_SETFL, fcntl(0, F_GETFL) | O_NONBLOCK);
sleep(4);
int numRead = read(0, buf, 4);
if (numRead > 0) {
	printf("You said: %s", buf);
}	</code>
	<li>"sleep(4)" means do nothing for 4 seconds.
	<li>"read(0, buf, 4)" means do nothing until you can read from a buffer.
	<li>But "fcntl(...)" changes the meaning of BOTH<ul>
	<li>It changes sleep to end early if a read completes (that is, sleep for UP TO 4)
	<li>It changes read to end early if sleep completes (that is read whatever shows up within 4 seconds, including nothing).
	<li>But we have two different lines of code that kinda run at the same time.
	</ul>
	<li>C bad. C bad!

    <h2>Fork()</h2>"If there's a fork in the road, take it." -computers 
	<ul>
	<li>If C is gonna do two things at the same time, it should be less sketchy and use like, code blocks.
	<code>NAME
       fork - create a child process

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       pid_t fork(void);

DESCRIPTION
       fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling 
       process.  The new process is referred to as the child 
       process.  The calling process is referred to as the 
       parent process.</code>
	<li>Okay how does this thing work.
</section>

<section>
<h2>Fork()</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Let's use it...
<code class="c">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    if(fork())
    {
        printf("Tis I, the elder and more terrible process.\n") ;
    } else {
        printf("Tis I, the more youthful and novel process.\n") ;
    }
    return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>"If there's a fork, take it"
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ gcc text.c ; ./a.out
Tis I, the elder and more terrible process
Tis I, the more youthful and novel process
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ </code>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Fork()</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Sleep and read at the same time.
<code class="c">void main() {
	char buf[20];
	if(fork()) {
		sleep(4) ;
	} else {
		int numRead = read(0, buf, 4);
		if (numRead > 0) {
			printf("You said: %s", buf);
		}
	}
}</code>
<li>This is a bit cleaner.<ul>
<li>No matter what, the program exits after 4 seconds.
<li>If there's input text (type and hit enter) it is returned.
<li>There's codeblocks splitting up the execution clearly.
</ul>
<li>Basically after fork() two different programs run, elder and youth.
<li>They can do things "at the same time".
<li>When elder ends, they both end.
<li>If you negate fork, then it doesn't work (elder must sleeper).
</section>

<section>
<h2>Fork()</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>The elder and the youth know not how to share.
<code class="c">	int x = 7 ; // worlds greatest int dont @ me
	if(fork()) {
		x += 1 ;
		wait(NULL) ; // wait for youth, sys/wait.h
	} else {
		x += 2 ;
	}
</code>
<li>x never gets to 10
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ gcc text.c ; ./a.out
x = 9
x = 8
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ </code>
<li>Using wait() to determine precedence has pros and cons.
<li>Not sharing has pros and cons.
<li>There's ways to share info (like sockets of course) but do we want to do that.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Fork()</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>For the worst thing you've ever seen in your life, share memory with a file.
<code class="c">    if (fork()) {
        for ( ; 1 ; i = (i + 1) % 26 ) {
            c = 'A' + i ;
            fopen(FNAME, "w") ; fwrite(&c, 1, 1, fp) ; fclose(fp) ; sleep(SLEEP) ;
        }
    } else {
        for ( ; 1 ; ) {
            printf("%c\n", c) ;
            fopen(FNAME, "r") ; fread(&c, 1, 1, fp)  ; fclose(fp) ; sleep(SLEEP) ;
        }
    }
</code>
<li>This is a good way to find out why you need to null check system calls...
<li>But if you try it a few times it'll probably not break instantly at least.
<li>Sleep before fclose to cause disasters at high probability.
</ul><p>Okay but how are we supposed to wait around to read something for a fixed amount of time?

    <h2>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</h2>Basically fork() was the worst so UNIX/POSIX invented pthreads
	<ul>
	<code>NAME
       pthread_create - create a new thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                          void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_create() function starts a new thread in the calling process.
       The new thread starts execution by invoking start_routine(); arg is passed
       as the sole argument of start_routine().</code>
	<li>Okay how does this thing work.
</section>

<section>
<h2>Function pointers</h2>
<code>void *(*start_routine) (void *)</code>

<ul>
  <li>That is a pointer to a function accepts a void * argument and has a void * return value.
  <ul><li>Here's an example:
  <code>void *func( void *ptr ) { 
    while(!sleep(1)) { 
        printf("%d\n", *(int *)ptr ) ; 
    }
    return NULL ;
}</code>
  <li>Here's how we'd make a variable that describes func()
  <code>void * (*fptr)(void *) = &func ;</code>
  </ul>
  <li>When we make a pthread, it needs somewhere to start executing - kinda like main().
  <ul><li>With fork(), execution just followed the fork() call - again, pros and cons.
  </ul>
  <li>Void * argument and return allows us to <ul>
  <li>Use a pointer or struct to hold an arguments or return any values
  <li>Use casts to read from the arguments or return value.
  <code>printf("%d\n", *(int *)ptr ) ;</code>
</section>

<section>
<h2>pthread_create</h2>
<code>pthread_create( &tid, NULL, &func, (void *) &val ) ;</code>

<ul>
  <li>Imagine we have func, which prints its argument every one second.
  <li>Here's how we set up a pthread to run func.
  <code>void main() {
    pthread_t tid ;
    int val = 0 ;
    pthread_create( &tid, NULL, &func, (void *) &val ) ;
    while(!sleep(1)) { val++ ; }
}</code>
  <li>pthread_create has three arguments:
  <ul><li>Where to store the thread id
  <li>Some options, which we will deal with latter or never
  <li>The big spooky function pointer #ominous
  <li>The arguments as a void *, usually casted from a meaningful data structure or data type.
  </ul>
  <li>This code then keeps increasing val, and we can observe what happens...</code>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pthreads</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Pretty unlikely to get numbers exactly in order, and that's okay.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
0
2
3
4
4
6
7
8
9
10</code>
<li>There's way to synchronize this (out of scope). "man -k pthread_spin"
<li>This is the cool, good, fun way to do things.
<li>C good!
</section>

<section>
<h2>exit/join</h2>
<code>int socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, int protocol);</code>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>When you create a pthread, it runs until the whatever created the thread terminates.
<li>Sometimes, we want to run until the last pthread is done with whatever it's doing.
<li>We achieve this with pthread_join and pthread_exit.
<code>int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);
void pthread_exit(void *retval);</code>
<li>We can think of pthread_exit similar to stdlib exit() - it's a way to end the thread, rather than the program.
<li>We can think of pthread_join similar to wait() - it's a way to keep the caller around until a callee finishes their job.
<li>Let's see an example that I tricked ChatGPT into making. It's a little scuffed, but fun.

<h2>Word Count Problem and Pthreads Solution</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>The word count problem involves counting the number of words in a given text file. To efficiently solve this problem, we can utilize multiple threads with the pthreads library.</p>
<li>Using pthreads allows us to divide the file into smaller chunks and assign each chunk to a separate thread for processing. Each thread independently counts the words within its assigned chunk, and the individual counts are later combined to obtain the total word count.</p>
<li>This approach leverages parallel processing, enabling faster execution compared to a single-threaded solution, especially for large files. By utilizing pthreads, we can efficiently tackle the word count problem by distributing the workload across multiple threads, resulting in improved performance.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Include Libraries</h2>
<ul>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>
  <li> First, the code includes necessary libraries for pthreads, file operations, and standard input-output.
  <li> These libraries provide functions for thread creation, file handling, memory allocation, and printing to the console.
<code>#define MAX_THREADS 4
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024</code>
  <li> Constants are defined for maximum threads and buffer size.
  <li> These constants are used to control the number of threads and the size of the buffer for file reading.
</ul>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Define Thread Data Structure</h2>
<ul>
<code>struct thread_data {
    char *buffer;
    int start;
    int end;
    int word_count;
};</code>
  <li> A structure is defined to hold data for each thread.
  <li> It includes a buffer to store file content, start and end indices for processing, and a word count.
  <li> Quick, how many bytes is thread_data?
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Thread Function</h2>
<ul>
<code>void* count_words(void *arg) {
    struct thread_data *data = (struct thread_data*)arg;
    for (int i = data->start; i &lt; data->end; i++) {
        if (isspace(data->buffer[i])) {
            data->word_count++;
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}</code>
  <li> The thread function 'count_words' counts the number of words in a given range of the buffer.
  <li> It iterates through the buffer and increments the word count when encountering whitespace characters.
  <li> Quick, what is the type of count_words?  Why?
  <li> ChatGPT uses "isspace" here - it's counting spaces, not words. 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Main Function</h2>
<ul>
<code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s &lt;filename&gt;\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    FILE *file = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    if (!file) {
        printf("Could not open file.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    // Remaining code omitted for brevity...
}</code>
  <li> The main function is the entry point of the program.
  <li> It takes a filename as an argument and opens the file for reading.
  <li> If the file cannot be opened, it prints an error message and exits.
  <li> If ChatGPT can null-check system calls, so can you.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Allocate Memory</h2>
<ul>
<code>char *buffer = (char*)malloc(file_size);
if (!buffer) {
    printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
    fclose(file);
    return 1;
}</code>
  <li> Memory is allocated for the buffer to hold the file content.
  <li> If memory allocation fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits.
  <li> I would never just rip an entire file into a malloc, since that seems mean to the computer, but this is a computer doing it to another computer so it's okay.
  <li> Quick, how do you do this without reading the entire file?
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Read File Content</h2>
<ul>
<code>fread(buffer, 1, file_size, file);
fclose(file);</code>
  <li> The file content is read into the buffer using fread.
  <li> If the read operation fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits.
  <li> ChatGPT just stopped checking the return values of system calls here. Your jobs are safe.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Create Threads</h2>
<ul>
<code>pthread_t threads[MAX_THREADS];
struct thread_data thread_data_array[MAX_THREADS];
int start = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_THREADS; i++) {
    thread_data_array[i].buffer = buffer;
    thread_data_array[i].start = start;
    thread_data_array[i].end = start + chunk_size + (i &lt; remaining ? 1 : 0);
    thread_data_array[i].word_count = 0;

    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, count_words, (void*)&thread_data_array[i]);

    start = thread_data_array[i].end;
}</code>
  <li> Threads are created to process the file content in parallel.
  <li> Each thread is assigned a portion of the buffer to count words.
  <li> I think a human would write this in a way where the arithmetic is easier, but maybe not.
  <li> Presumably a human wrote this somewhere and it's just plagiarized.
  <li> I was pretty sure count_words needed a unary & prefix there, but what do I know. It runs fine.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Join Threads</h2>
<ul>
<code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_THREADS; i++) {
    pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
}</code>
  <li> The main thread waits for all worker threads to finish using pthread_join.
  <li> This ensures that the total word count is accurate before printing.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Calculate Total Word Count</h2>
<ul>
<code>int total_word_count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_THREADS; i++) {
    total_word_count += thread_data_array[i].word_count;
}</code>
  <li> The total word count is calculated by summing up individual thread word counts.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Print Result</h2>
<ul>
<code>printf("Total word count: %d\n", total_word_count);
free(buffer);
return 0;</code>
  <li> The total word count is printed to the console.
  <li> Memory allocated for the buffer is freed to prevent memory leaks.
  <li> The program terminates successfully.
</ul>
</section>
