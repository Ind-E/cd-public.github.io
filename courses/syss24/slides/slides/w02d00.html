<h2>For hw0 you have to write some C.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once you have your own 271sp24, you should be able to compile the hw0 starting file "x_sort.c"
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$ gcc x_sort.c
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$ ./a.out
hello
Keep it up!
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$</code>
<li>It will provide you the minimal non-zero feedback that you are not done yet ("Keep it up!").
<li>You will do your work for hw0 inside the "sort" function x_sort.c... but first some background.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<ul>
<li>New language, new hello.
<li>In notes or in hw0, let's make and play with a new .c file.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$ touch test.c
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$</code>
<li>On Mac probably use atom or nano to edit.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$ nano test.c
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$</code>
<li>On PC probably use (and set up) VS Code.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$ code .
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/hw0$</code>
<li>On Linux I use gedit, but if you're on Linux you're also on your own.
<ul><li>vim isn't required, but it'd be a lot funnier if it were.

<h2>Boilerplate</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a starting C coder, I recommend starting *every* C project with following elements.
<li>You can treat this as boilerplate, but I will also tell you what it all means.
<li>When opening a new file, write:
<code>// This test.c, a file for testing C. (or another description) 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	printf("test\n") ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li>C, or more properly C99 (C standard revision 1999) has two main kinds of comments:
<ul><li>Single line comments, that preface with double slashes "//"
<li>Multiline comments, that are prefaced and punctuated with "/*" and "*/ respectively.</ul>
<code>int x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 ;
x = 10 ;
// x = 20 ;
printf("%d", x) ; // Prints "10"
y = 20 ;
/*
z = x * y ;
x = x * z ;
y = y * z ;
*/
printf("%d", y) ; // Prints "20"</code>
<p>It is good practice to end every line of code you write with a "//" comment until you write code with no bugs on the first try at P > .5.
</section>
<section>
<h2>#include</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Include-Syntax.html">Read more.</a>
<li>gcc and to my knowledge all C compilers utilize a "preprocessor" that runs over a .c file before attempting compilation.
<li>Lines of "code" prefixed with "#" are not C code specifically, but part of the C coding environment
<ul><li>Conceptually somewhere between actual honest-to-goodness C and bash in terms of how "C" it is.</ul>
<li>The "#include" preprocessor directive instructors the compiler to include code from other sources while compiling, in such as the &lt;stdio.h&gt; library.
<li>Latter in the semester, we will use "#include" to make multi-file programs.
</section>
<section>
<h2>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</h2>
<ul>
<li>The C print statement, "printf", is defined in &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
<ul><li>(Read: "Standard I/O" or "Standard Input/Output")</ul>
<li>If you don't include &lt;stdio.h&gt; but use printf, you will get this <b>warning</b>.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:6:9: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

<p>I will receive an alarming number of Discord messages containing warnings similar to this one. That is okay, but...
</section>

<h2>Let gcc help you</h2>
<ul>
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:6:9: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    6 |         printf("test\n") ;
      |         ^~~~~~</code>
<li>Ahem</li>
<code>test.c:1:1: note: include ‘&lt;stdio.h&gt;’ or provide a declaration of ‘printf’
  +++ |+#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    1 | // This test.c, a file for testing C. (or another description)</code>
<li>As you were</li>
<code>test.c:6:9: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘printf’ [-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch]
    6 |         printf("test\n") ;

test.c:6:9: note: include ‘&lt;stdio.h&gt;’ or provide a declaration of ‘printf’
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<p>gcc explicitly tells you what code to write and where. It is helping you!
</section>
<section>
<h2>Warnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Of note, these messages are warnings and not errors.
<code>test.c:6:9: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    6 |         printf("test\n") ;
      |         ^~~~~~</code>
<li>Code with warnings but no errors will compile, but may behave unpredictably or erratically.
<li>Code with errors will not compile and a new file to run, such as a.out, will not be created.
<ul>
<li>You will compile code, get an error, ignore the error, and run an older version of your code and then become confused.
<li>You will ask for help and I or someone else will link this slide.
<li>Prove me wrong.</ul>
</section>

<h2>Implicit function declaration.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Of note, these messages are warnings and not errors.
<code>test.c:6:9: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    6 |         printf("test\n") ;
      |         ^~~~~~</code>
<li>An "implicit function" declaration occurs when you call a function that you have not written or included.
<ul><li>Review: What does it mean to call a function?</ul>
<li>The gcc "-w" flag will direct gcc not to print warnings.
<ul><li>As a new programmer, you should aim to write code with no warnings or errors.
<li>You should use "-w" only as a tool to focus on errors before fixing warnings.
<li>Do not submit code to be graded with errors or warnings. Instead, reduce the scope of the code until you can do what you are trying to do without any errors or warnings.

}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>main()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Recall: C is not a programming language.
<li>By default, lines of C code are not run unless called.
<li>The C compiler looks for a function named <b>exactly</b> main, and produces an executable (a program) that calls this function.
<li><b>The only code in a C file that runs is main(), and the code it calls.</b>
<li>Test this: Write C code with no main().
<code>// This test.c, a file for testing C. (or another description) 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // for printf

int notmain()
{
	printf("test\n") ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>main()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>No main no gain.

<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code>
<li>As in you do not gain an a.out.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ ls
test.c
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li>Note: That is error. Not a warning.
<ul><li>Review: What is the difference between errors and warnings?
<li>Review: "ld" is two characters... what does that tell us about the history of "ld"?
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>main()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>You can also try writing lines of C with no enclosing function.
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // for printf
printf("test\n") ;</code>
<li>This is fine in Python (this would be a script) but this does not constitute a program.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c
test.c:3:8: error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before string constant
    3 | printf("test\n") ;
      |        ^~~~~~~~
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li>Note: That is error. Not a warning.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>int main()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>You can give main return types other than int.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ echo "int main() {return 0;}" >test.c && gcc test.c && ./a.out

    1 | string main() {return 0;}
      | ^~~~~~
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li>Use "&&" to run multiple commands or utilities in a single line.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>int main()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>We use int main() and int main() only because C++ requires int main() and you might want to
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ echo "int main() {return 0;}" >test.c && g++ test.c && ./a.out
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ echo "void main() {return;}" >test.c && g++ test.c && ./a.out
test.c:1:1: error: ‘::main’ must return ‘int’
    1 | void main() {return;}
      | ^~~~
test.c: In function ‘int main()’:
test.c:1:14: error: return-statement with no value, in function returning ‘int’ [-fpermissive]
    1 | void main() {return;}
      |              ^~~~~~
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li>That's right, by using g++ instead of gcc you now know C++ (well you don't know C, but you will).
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>return 0 ;</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Remember this?
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function `_start':

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code>
<li>"error: ld returned 1 exit status"
<li>Historically, return values from executables other than 0 have denoted error conditions.
<li>Return 0 from your executables for compatability with other code respecting this convention.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>exit(1) ;</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to know this yet, but you may look back at these slides.
<li>This is how you return with 1 exit status:
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // for printf
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; // for exit

int main()
{
	if (0)
	{
		exit(1) ;
	}

<h2>printf</h2>
<ul>
<li>The built-in C print function is a format print function.
<ul><li>Note: C printf() does not have a built-in newline - Python print() does!
<li>This exists in Python but is relatively unpopular as far as I've seen:
<code>txt = "For only {price:.2f} dollars!"
print(txt.format(price = 49)) </code>
<li>That's a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp">w3 rip</a> because I have never actually written a line of Python code in my life.
<li>Here's what it looks like with no formatting elements applied:
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; txt = "hello there"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(txt.format())
hello there
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("hello there".format())
hello there
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>That's basically printf("hi") - a format print with no formatting.
</section>
<section>
<h2>printf</h2>
<ul>
<li>Here's a non-trivial format print.
<li>This exists in Python but is relatively unpopular as far as I've seen:
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // for printf

int main()
{
	int rval = 0 ; // for "return value"
	printf("rval = %d\n", rval) ;
	return rval ;
}</code>
<li>"d" here stands for decimal, which is for integers printed in base 10.
<ul><li>Usually you'll use %d for numerical data, but not always.</ul>
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c && ./a.out
rval = 0
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li>Most of the Python format tech you know will apply either directly or via Stack Overflow/ChatGPT translation.

<h2>Starting C</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, everything is an object.
<ul><li>Strings, integers, floats, dictionaries, files.</ul>
<li>Objects tend to be able to tell you what kind of thing they are.
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; txt = "hello there"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(txt.format())
hello there
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("hello there".format())
hello there
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(txt)
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(print)
&lt;class 'builtin_function_or_method'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(print(txt))
hello there
&lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>In Python, any line of code is ultimately going to be some kind of object.
</section>
<section>
<h2>C Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, there are no objects
<li>To keep track of what is happening, we have to label everything with a type.
<li>Types tell the compiler how many bits 'n bytes to set aside for result of a computation.
<li>int main() tells the compiler how many bits to tell the computer to expect.

<h2>Variables</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, when we want a variable, we just assign a label to an object with "="
<ul><li>Read "single equals"
<li>If you like it then you should've put a ring on it equals.</ul>
<li>For now, that's either int (number) or char * (string, more or less).
<ul><li>I say "int" and "character star", "char star", or "character pointer"
<li>Star means "pointer" - more on that someday^TM</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	int rval = 0 ; // variable for a number
	// variables for strings, more or less
	char *str0 = "If thou dost appreciate/" ;
	char *str1 = "Then thine shalt place/" ;
	char *str2 = "Yon jewel upon/" ;
	char *str3 = "Ye olde fingere." ; 
	return rval ;
}</code>
<li>You can translate a Python variable assignment to C by specifying a type and punctuating with a semicolon.

<h2>Python bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>People are allowed to like things, so you are allowed to like this.
<li>I don't.
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y, s, t = 1, 2, "h", "i"

<h2>Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, the function "+" has a fixed type - it accepts two numbers, and returns a number.
<li>In arithmetic, "+" is commonly used as an infix operator.
<li>For a trivial example, let's write "add()" - a prefix integer addition function.
<ul>
<li>Why might we want this?
<li>What does infix mean?
<li>What does prefix mean?
<li>What does operator mean?
</ul>
<code>int add(int x, int y)
{
	return x + y ;
}</code>
<li>We can write this in Python too of course.
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x:int,y:int) -&gt; int:
...     return x + y
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>In C, giving a non-integer x with raise a compiler warning.
<li>In Python, the types are ignored by the runtime.
<li>Python bad! C good!
</section>
<section>
<h2>Return Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, functions have exactly one return type.
<li>C functions are declared the same way as variables...
<ul>
<li>However, they are not assigned using single equals.
<li>C is an imperative (command) based language!
<li>Instead, they are defined by creating a code block of commands.
<li>C code blocks are enclosed in these lil squigglers -> {}
</ul>

<li>C functions may have an arbitrary number of arguments...
<ul>
<li>However, each argument must have, itself, exactly one type.
</ul>
<code>int add(int x, int y)
{
	return x + y ;
}

int main()
{
	return add(0,0) ;
}</code>
<li>Instead of saying "I'm stuck"/"I don't know" say "Wow I would love to think about types rn fr fr".
</section>
<section>
<h2>Python bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>My favorite thing is just slamming down a comma in the middle of my unpunctuated return statements surrounded by whitespace.
<li>Wait no it's not,
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def both(x,y):
...     return x, y
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; both(1, "1")
(1, '1')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>It should be against the law to write code like this and it is, this is only allowed in scripts*
<li>*That's not true at all but it'd be cool if it were.
<li>Also Python just swapping double quotes for single quotes...
</section>
<section>
<h2>C Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>C will warn for type based shenanigans at compile time...
<li>If you try to add strings together, gcc tells you to to rethink your decisions.

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, we don't really have the classical concept of array
<ul><li>Historically lists and arrays were different things...
<li>Python lists are closer to being array-lists - an implementation of a list *abstract data type* using an array *data structure*</ul>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(arr)
&lt;class 'list'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>The List type differs from the Array implementation in a few ways:
<ul><li>Arrays are of fixed length. 
<ul><li>We cannot add or remove elements, only replace.</ul>
<li>Arrays must contain only elements of the same type.
<ul><li>We cannot place chars and ints in the same array.</ul>
<li>Arrays do not know their own length or type.
<ul><li>When using arrays, we must keep track of how many elements of what type there are.</ul>
<li>Arrays exist at fixed location in physical memory.
<ul><li>This will matter more latter.</ul></ul>
<li>Let's see some arrays.</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, we create an array by creating a variable as we do any other variable.
<ul><li>We declare the type.
<li>We give a name.
<li>We optionally assign a value.
</ul>
<li>For arrays specifically, we use boxy bracket "[]" notation to give the length of the array.
<ul><li>We provide a length whenever we declare a new array variable.
<li>We use the same notation to access elements of the array, indexed by zero.</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	int arr[3] = { 1, 2, 3 } ;
	arr[0] = arr[0] - 1 ;
	return arr[0] ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can create arrays of ints or of chars.
<ul><li>Or of anything else.
<li>We've actually worked with arrays of characters already...</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = "hi\n\0" ;
	printf("%s", arr) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>We can write this using the same notation as our int arrays.
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = { 'h', 'i', '\n', 0 } ;
	printf("%s", arr) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Check-in: What would you expect (Python) ord('\0') to be?
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>"%c,  %d"</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>As you theoretically know from CS 151, a character is just a number in &integers;<sub>256</sub>
<ul><li>In Python we use "ord" and "chr"
<li>In C, this abstraction doesn't exist - we just have a value in &integers;<sub>256</sub>
<li>We can view the character value with "%c" and the numerical value with "%d"</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = { 'h', 'i', '\n', 0 } ;
	printf("c = %c, d = %d\n", arr[0], arr[0]) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>This prints the ascii character and the character value.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
c = h, d = 104
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>It isn't the case in C that a char is either a printable ascii character or a numerical value, rather it is simply 8 bits or 1 byte of data, and how that data is interpreted is determined by the programmer and respected by the compiler.
</section>
<section>
<h2>'\0'</h2>
<ul>
<li>As noted previously, arrays in C do not store their own length.
<ul><li>This is variously regarded as "kinda annoying" or "the worst thing ever".
<li>You may have noticed you know Python.
<li>C... bad???</ul>
<li>For strings, C uses "null-termination":
<ul>
<li>Every string is stored in an array of characters of length at least one greater than the string length.
<li>After the final character of the string, a single non-printing '\0' or 0 character is added.
<li>Built-in C functions respect null termination, and the compiler implements null-termination automatically.
<li>When declaring arrays, we must provide the null-termination*
<ul><li>In practice, modern compilers don't trust you and will often do this for you.
<li>This good and bad news - it may mask errors that should've found earlier, but makes quick coding easier.
</ul>
<li>While '\0' is simply 0, I will refer to it *when used in C strings* as "the null terminator" to be clear what I am talking about abstractly.
<ul><li>To C, '\0' == 0 but to me, these mean different things.
<code>char arr[4] = { 'h', 'i', '\n', '\0' } ; // Don't mix ascii and numericals. </code>
</section>
<section>
<h2>'h' and "h"</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, single and double quotes are equivalent or something.
<ul><li>This is variously regarded as "kinda annoying" or "the worst thing ever".</ul>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'h' == "h"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>Python... bad???
<li>C uses single quotes for characters and double quotes for strings.
</section>
<section>
<h2>'h' and "h"</h2>
<ul>
<li>C uses single quotes for characters and double quotes for strings. Try it:
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = { "h", "i", "\n", "\0" } ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Compiler blocks this with a series of errors:
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'h' == "h"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>I keep talking about numbers of bits and bytes. Well, there's a way to measure that.
<li>gcc, and to my knowledge every C compiler, has a "sizeof()" operator
<li>sizeof isn't really part of C the way #include isn't, but it's part of the C ecosystem.
<li>When you write C code, before it is compiled, the preprocessor will go through and replace every sizeof() with the number of bytes the compiler will use.
<li>This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but especially helpful to learn about the language.
<code>int main()
{
	printf("ints are %d big\n", sizeof(int)) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>There's only one little wrinkle to work out.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:14:27: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘long unsigned int’ [-Wformat=]
   14 |         printf("ints are %d big\n", sizeof(int)) ;
      |                          ~^         ~~~~~~~~~~~
      |                           |         |
      |                           int       long unsigned int
      |                          %ld
ints are 4 big
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>sizeof() doesn't run an int or a char, it returns a special, other thing.
<li>gcc says use %ld (long decimal, for things bigger than ints) so we do so.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>There's only one little wrinkle to work out.
<code>int main()
{
    printf("longs are %ld big, ints are %ld big, chars are %ld big\n", 
           sizeof(long unsigned int), sizeof(int), sizeof(char)) ;
    return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>This tells us how big a long unsigned int is (but not *what* it is).
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
longs are 8 big, ints are 4 big, chars are 1 big
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>Incidentally, it also tells us the measurement - we measure things in terms of how much bigger they are than char.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>char *</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Back to arrays.
<li>Students commonly think "ah ha, I can use sizeof() to not have to learn to program, I mean, to program efficently and well just like in Python, and not track what size arrays are."
<li>Kinda.
<li>First of all note we have not used sizeof() on variables, only on types so far.
<li>That said, we can use it on variables too, but should be careful.
<code>int main()
{
	char *str = "hello\n" ;
	printf("str is of size %ld\n", sizeof(str)) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Surely this will tell me that the string "hello\n" has 6 characters in it. Right? RIGHT????
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
str is of size 8
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li><b>Sizeof is not telling you how big of an array you have.</b>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Wait a minute - char * is the same size as the thing we print with %ld.
<code>int main()
{
	char *str = "hello\n" ;
	printf("%ld\n", str) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>

<li>We get a warning but we also get a value.
<li><b>"str" is "94293169704970".</b>
<li>If you go to stack overflow with this error, it will probably tell you to use "%p" which removes the error but prints in hexadecimal instead of decimal.

<section>
<h2><code>char *</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Takeaway: char *str or char arr[3] are different kinds of things that characters.
<li>They are pointers - the locations of a series of adjacent characters in computer memory.<ul>
<li>A character is a value
<li>A character pointer is the address of a character, and this character itself has a value.</ul>
<li>We can use this to write non-format print.
<code>void print(char *str)
{
	printf("%s\n", str) ; // add newline a la python
	return ;
}

int main()
{
	char arr[6] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' } ; // no newline
	print(arr) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>char *</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>We use char * in the function argument to account for arrays of any size.
<li>We use char arr[6] in the main function so we know we have enough space.
<li>The compiler helps us a lot here - this is sloppy, but good enough to learn from and won't draw any errors.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out

<li>while loops do not always require initialization, it is common to do so
<li>This allows running some fixed number of loops, walking down an array, etc.
<code>int i = 0 ;</code>
<li>Adopting a coding style utilizing "i" will probably make reading other people's code easier.
<li>You probably always do this.
<li>Like etc etc, int i = 0 ; is not part of the while loop, but part of the while loop ecosystem.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Declaration</h2>
<ul>
<li>while loops are defined using the while keyword applied to a parenthetical expression that is tested against zero.
<li>This coding style is a historical reason for null-terminated strings and vice versa.
<code>while (str[i])</code>
<li>While learning, you might want to be more explicit in your code:
<code>while (str[i] != '\0')</code>
<li>Being explicit is often logically equivalent, and the same speed or not much slower.
<li>Being explicit may introduce more typing and can lead to more errors on that end.
<li>Optimize your coding style to minimize errors.
<li>It is legal to inline loops but can be hard to read.
<code>while (str[i++]) {putchar(str[i]);}</code>
<li>You can write code like that as soon as you can tell me what it's doing!
</section>
<section>
<h2>Iteration</h2>
<ul>
<li>C programmers (you) love to write infinite loops than gasp when they are infinite.
<li>This was the first thing I wrote:
<code>void print(char *str)
{
	int i = 0 ; // i for iterator, by overwhelming convention
	while (str[i]) // that is, while str[i] != '\0' - see why its zero now?
	{
		printf("%c", str[i]) ; // or use putchar()
	}
	printf("\n") ; // add newline a la python
	return ;
}</code>
<li>Wow that sure looks like it'd work in Python (it will work in a for loop).
<li>C affords us an extremely cool unary iteration operator to help us remember to have a good time.
<code>i++ ;</code>
<li>This just means "increase i by 1" but is much shorter and...
<code>while (str[i++]) {putchar(str[i]);}</code>
<li>Can be included in other lines so you can write crisper loops.

<h2>While Boilerplate</h2>
<ul>
<code>void print(char *str)
{
    int i = 0 ;                // initialization
    while (str[i])             // declaration
    {
        printf("%c", str[i]) ; // computation
        i++ ;                  // iteration
    }
    printf("\n") ;             // termination
    return ;
}</code>
<li>You will not always need all of these elements.
</section>
<section>
<h2>If Boilerplate</h2>
<ul>
<li>if is the trivial case of while.
<code>void pos(int val)
{
    if (val > 0)               // declaration
    {
        printf("pos\n") ;      // computation
        return ;
    }
    printf("neg\n") ;          // termination
    return ;
}</code>
<li>You will not always need all of these elements.
</section>
<section>
<h2>If Boilerplate</h2>
<ul>
<li>if also supports while, if (kneeslap) you are into that.
<code>void pos(int val)
{
    if (val > 0)               // declaration
    {
        printf("pos") ;        // computation
    } else {                   // declaration
        printf("neg") ;        // computation
    }
    printf("\n") ;             // termination
    return ;
}</code>
<li>You will not always need all of these elements.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Lab Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do hw0.
<ul><li>"I did" -> Ensure your solution is nlog(n) complexity
<ul><li>"I did" -> Implement it using radix sort
<ul><li>"I did" -> Implement it recursively using bitwise operators
<ul><li>"What's that?" -> Google.</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<li>Submit on GitHub.
<ul><li>"I did" -> Ensure your code is adequately documented.
<ul><li>"I did" -> Ensure your version control is adequately documented.
