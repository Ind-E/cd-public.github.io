<section>
<h2>Starting C</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, everything is an object.
<ul><li>Strings, integers, floats, dictionaries, files.</ul>
<li>Objects tend to be able to tell you what kind of thing they are.
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; txt = "hello there"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(txt.format())
hello there
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("hello there".format())
hello there
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(txt)
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(print)
&lt;class 'builtin_function_or_method'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(print(txt))
hello there
&lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>In Python, any line of code is ultimately going to be some kind of object.
</section>
<section>
<h2>C Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, there are no objects
<li>To keep track of what is happening, we have to label everything with a type.
<li>Types tell the compiler how many bits 'n bytes to set aside for result of a computation.
<li>int main() tells the compiler how many bits to tell the computer to expect.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ echo "int main() {return 0;}" >test.c && gcc test.c && ./a.out
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ echo "void main() {return;}" >test.c && gcc test.c && ./a.out
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ echo "int main() {return;}" >test.c && gcc test.c && ./a.out
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:1:13: warning: ‘return’ with no value, in function returning non-void
    1 | int main() {return;}
      |             ^~~~~~

    1 | int main() {return;}
      |     ^~~~
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>We can return any size or type of thing, but we have to say what we're doing - and actually do that.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, when we want a variable, we just assign a label to an object with "="
<ul><li>Read "single equals"
<li>If you like it then you should've put a ring on it equals.</ul>
<li>For now, that's either int (number) or char * (string, more or less).
<ul><li>I say "int" and "character star", "char star", or "character pointer"
<li>Star means "pointer" - more on that someday^TM</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	int rval = 0 ; // variable for a number
	// variables for strings, more or less
	char *str0 = "If thou dost appreciate/" ;
	char *str1 = "Then thine shalt place/" ;
	char *str2 = "Yon jewel upon/" ;
	char *str3 = "Ye olde fingere." ; 
	return rval ;
}</code>
<li>You can translate a Python variable assignment to C by specifying a type and punctuating with a semicolon.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Python bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>People are allowed to like things, so you are allowed to like this.
<li>I don't.
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y, s, t = 1, 2, "h", "i"
&gt;&gt;&gt; x + y
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; x + s
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s + t
'hi'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>This is called operator overloading. It's not allowed in C.
</section>
<section>
<h2>C Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>You honestly mean to tell me "one" + "two" should be "onetwo" and not "three"?
<li>If you try to add strings together, gcc tells you to to rethink your decisions.
<code>int main()
{
	char *str0 = "If thou dost appreciate/" ;
	char *str1 = "Then thine shalt place/" ;
	printf(str0 + str1) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Thanks, C.
<code><code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out

user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$
</code></code>
<li>What does "binary" mean here? (Hint: MATH 251W)
</section>
<section>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, the function "+" has a fixed type - it accepts two numbers, and returns a number.
<li>In arithmetic, "+" is commonly used as an infix operator.
<li>For a trivial example, let's write "add()" - a prefix integer addition function.
<ul>
<li>Why might we want this?
<li>What does infix mean?
<li>What does prefix mean?
<li>What does operator mean?
</ul>
<code>int add(int x, int y)
{
	return x + y ;
}</code>
<li>We can write this in Python too of course.
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(x:int,y:int) -&gt; int:
...     return x + y
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>In C, giving a non-integer x with raise a compiler warning.
<li>In Python, the types are ignored by the runtime.
<li>Python bad! C good!
</section>
<section>
<h2>Return Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, functions have exactly one return type.
<li>C functions are declared the same way as variables...
<ul>
<li>However, they are not assigned using single equals.
<li>C is an imperative (command) based language!
<li>Instead, they are defined by creating a code block of commands.
<li>C code blocks are enclosed in these lil squigglers -> {}
</ul>

<li>C functions may have an arbitrary number of arguments...
<ul>
<li>However, each argument must have, itself, exactly one type.
</ul>
<code>int add(int x, int y)
{
	return x + y ;
}

int main()
{
	return add(0,0) ;
}</code>
<li>Instead of saying "I'm stuck"/"I don't know" say "Wow I would love to think about types rn fr fr".
</section>
<section>
<h2>Python bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>My favorite thing is just slamming down a comma in the middle of my unpunctuated return statements surrounded by whitespace.
<li>Wait no it's not,
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def both(x,y):
...     return x, y
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; both(1, "1")
(1, '1')
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>It should be against the law to write code like this and it is, this is only allowed in scripts*
<li>*That's not true at all but it'd be cool if it were.
<li>Also Python just swapping double quotes for single quotes...
</section>
<section>
<h2>C Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>C will warn for type based shenanigans at compile time...
<li>If you try to add strings together, gcc tells you to to rethink your decisions.

<li>Thanks, C and also thanks Linux kernel (the OS that stops this).
<li>Segmentation faults are a recurring source of frustration for learning C programmers, but that frustrating you feel is called "learning" and is good for you, I think.
<ul><li>Back in my day after a segmentation fault we had to change the tapes in our Turing machines by hand.
<li>Next time you have 7 hours to waste ask me about Turing machines.

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, we don't really have the classical concept of array
<ul><li>Historically lists and arrays were different things...
<li>Python lists are closer to being array-lists - an implementation of a list *abstract data type* using an array *data structure*</ul>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(arr)
&lt;class 'list'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>The List type differs from the Array implementation in a few ways:
<ul><li>Arrays are of fixed length. 
<ul><li>We cannot add or remove elements, only replace.</ul>
<li>Arrays must contain only elements of the same type.
<ul><li>We cannot place chars and ints in the same array.</ul>
<li>Arrays do not know their own length or type.
<ul><li>When using arrays, we must keep track of how many elements of what type there are.</ul>
<li>Arrays exist at fixed location in physical memory.
<ul><li>This will matter more latter.</ul></ul>
<li>Let's see some arrays.</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<ul>
<li>In C, we create an array by creating a variable as we do any other variable.
<ul><li>We declare the type.
<li>We give a name.
<li>We optionally assign a value.
</ul>
<li>For arrays specifically, we use boxy bracket "[]" notation to give the length of the array.
<ul><li>We provide a length whenever we declare a new array variable.
<li>We use the same notation to access elements of the array, indexed by zero.</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	int arr[3] = { 1, 2, 3 } ;
	arr[0] = arr[0] - 1 ;
	return arr[0] ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can create arrays of ints or of chars.
<ul><li>Or of anything else.
<li>We've actually worked with arrays of characters already...</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = "hi\n\0" ;
	printf("%s", arr) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>We can write this using the same notation as our int arrays.
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = { 'h', 'i', '\n', 0 } ;
	printf("%s", arr) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Check-in: What would you expect (Python) ord('\0') to be?
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>"%c,  %d"</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>As you theoretically know from CS 151, a character is just a number in &integers;<sub>256</sub>
<ul><li>In Python we use "ord" and "chr"
<li>In C, this abstraction doesn't exist - we just have a value in &integers;<sub>256</sub>
<li>We can view the character value with "%c" and the numerical value with "%d"</ul>
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = { 'h', 'i', '\n', 0 } ;
	printf("c = %c, d = %d\n", arr[0], arr[0]) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>This prints the ascii character and the character value.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
c = h, d = 104
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>It isn't the case in C that a char is either a printable ascii character or a numerical value, rather it is simply 8 bits or 1 byte of data, and how that data is interpreted is determined by the programmer and respected by the compiler.
</section>
<section>
<h2>'\0'</h2>
<ul>
<li>As noted previously, arrays in C do not store their own length.
<ul><li>This is variously regarded as "kinda annoying" or "the worst thing ever".
<li>You may have noticed you know Python.
<li>C... bad???</ul>
<li>For strings, C uses "null-termination":
<ul>
<li>Every string is stored in an array of characters of length at least one greater than the string length.
<li>After the final character of the string, a single non-printing '\0' or 0 character is added.
<li>Built-in C functions respect null termination, and the compiler implements null-termination automatically.
<li>When declaring arrays, we must provide the null-termination*
<ul><li>In practice, modern compilers don't trust you and will often do this for you.
<li>This good and bad news - it may mask errors that should've found earlier, but makes quick coding easier.
</ul>
<li>While '\0' is simply 0, I will refer to it *when used in C strings* as "the null terminator" to be clear what I am talking about abstractly.
<ul><li>To C, '\0' == 0 but to me, these mean different things.
<code>char arr[4] = { 'h', 'i', '\n', '\0' } ; // Don't mix ascii and numericals. </code>
</section>
<section>
<h2>'h' and "h"</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Python, single and double quotes are equivalent or something.
<ul><li>This is variously regarded as "kinda annoying" or "the worst thing ever".</ul>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'h' == "h"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<li>Python... bad???
<li>C uses single quotes for characters and double quotes for strings.
</section>
<section>
<h2>'h' and "h"</h2>
<ul>
<li>C uses single quotes for characters and double quotes for strings. Try it:
<code>int main()
{
	char arr[4] = { "h", "i", "\n", "\0" } ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Compiler blocks this with a series of errors:
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'h' == "h"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>I keep talking about numbers of bits and bytes. Well, there's a way to measure that.
<li>gcc, and to my knowledge every C compiler, has a "sizeof()" operator
<li>sizeof isn't really part of C the way #include isn't, but it's part of the C ecosystem.
<li>When you write C code, before it is compiled, the preprocessor will go through and replace every sizeof() with the number of bytes the compiler will use.
<li>This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but especially helpful to learn about the language.
<code>int main()
{
	printf("ints are %d big\n", sizeof(int)) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>There's only one little wrinkle to work out.
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:14:27: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘long unsigned int’ [-Wformat=]
   14 |         printf("ints are %d big\n", sizeof(int)) ;
      |                          ~^         ~~~~~~~~~~~
      |                           |         |
      |                           int       long unsigned int
      |                          %ld
ints are 4 big
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>sizeof() doesn't run an int or a char, it returns a special, other thing.
<li>gcc says use %ld (long decimal, for things bigger than ints) so we do so.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>There's only one little wrinkle to work out.
<code>int main()
{
    printf("longs are %ld big, ints are %ld big, chars are %ld big\n", 
           sizeof(long unsigned int), sizeof(int), sizeof(char)) ;
    return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>This tells us how big a long unsigned int is (but not *what* it is).
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
longs are 8 big, ints are 4 big, chars are 1 big
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ </code>
<li>Incidentally, it also tells us the measurement - we measure things in terms of how much bigger they are than char.
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>char *</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Back to arrays.
<li>Students commonly think "ah ha, I can use sizeof() to not have to learn to program, I mean, to program efficently and well just like in Python, and not track what size arrays are."
<li>Kinda.
<li>First of all note we have not used sizeof() on variables, only on types so far.
<li>That said, we can use it on variables too, but should be careful.
<code>int main()
{
	char *str = "hello\n" ;
	printf("str is of size %ld\n", sizeof(str)) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
<li>Surely this will tell me that the string "hello\n" has 6 characters in it. Right? RIGHT????
<code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$ gcc test.c ; ./a.out
str is of size 8
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/dev/as_zagreb/271sp24/notes$</code>
<li><b>Sizeof is not telling you how big of an array you have.</b>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Wait a minute - char * is the same size as the thing we print with %ld.
<code>int main()
{
	char *str = "hello\n" ;
	printf("%ld\n", str) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>
</section>
<section>
<h2><code>sizeof()</code></h2>

<li>We get a warning but we also get a value.
<li><b>"str" is "94293169704970".</b>
<li>If you go to stack overflow with this error, it will probably tell you to use "%p" which removes the error but prints in hexadecimal instead of decimal.

<h2><code>char *</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>Takeaway: char *str or char arr[3] are different kinds of things that characters.
<li>They are pointers - the locations of a series of adjacent characters in computer memory.<ul>
<li>A character is a value
<li>A character pointer is the address of a character, and this character itself has a value.</ul>
<li>We can use this to write non-format print.
<code>void print(char *str)
{
	printf("%s\n", str) ; // add newline a la python
	return ;
}

int main()
{
	char arr[6] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' } ; // no newline
	print(arr) ;
	return 0 ;
}</code>

<section>
<h2><code>char *</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>We use char * in the function argument to account for arrays of any size.
<li>We use char arr[6] in the main function so we know we have enough space.
<li>The compiler helps us a lot here - this is sloppy, but good enough to learn from and won't draw any errors.
