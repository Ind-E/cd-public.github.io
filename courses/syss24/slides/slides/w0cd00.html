<li>Final is assigned: "snek"
<li>As I always say "no step on snek"
<li>But I digress.
<li>It's here: <a href="https://cd-public.github.io/snek/snek.html">Linkaroo</a>
<li>The assignment description is a little buggy, so I'll be patching it as I find bugs, but previous years completed it amicably.
<li>Form pairs and figure out version control. Have fun!
<li>After we finish sockets (today?) you can do it.

    <h2>Sockets</h2>They're file pointers. 
	<ul>
	<li>From ChatGPT:
	<code>/* cut out a lot of setup, then */
while ((valread = read(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE)) > 0) {
	printf("%s", buffer);
	memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE); // Clear buffer for next read
}
	</code>
	<li>From Gemini:
	<code>/* cut out a lot of setup, then */
while ((n = read(sockfd, buffer, MAX_DATA - 1)) > 0) {
	buffer[n] = '\0';
	printf("%s\n", buffer);  // Print received message
	memset(buffer, 0, MAX_DATA);  // Clear buffer for next read
}
  </code>
  We learned file i/o before networking for this reason.

    <h2>Sockets</h2>They're file pointers, except they're not. 
	<ul>
	<li>"Sockets are not implemented as files in the traditional sense, but rather they are often represented as file descriptors in Unix-like operating systems."
	<li>Basically, C language/OS/whatever people could write "file_read" and "network_read" or just... not.
	<ul>
	<li>It's pretty easy to get into trouble with this, especially when not checking system calls.
	<ul>
	<li>A file on an hdd/ssd is much more reliable than a network connection.
	<li>A file "" is much less likely to have someone else messing with it.
	<li>Many interesting(=hard/fun) topics emerge from networking for this reason.
	</ul></ul><li>By working with networks, we both learn to do new things (networking) and get better at doing other things (writing reliable code).

<h2>Socket</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Socket programming has a higher minimum baseline complexity.
<li>We have have to introduce a series of concepts as a block.
<li>As a convenience for organizing our thoughts, the first thing is <span style="font-family: monospace;background-color:white;">socket()</span>
<code>NAME
       socket - create an endpoint for communication

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;          /* See NOTES */
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

DESCRIPTION
       socket()  creates  an  endpoint  for communication and returns a file descriptor that refers to that endpoint.</code>
<li>This is similar and distinct from fopen, but it rhymes.
<li>Whenever teaching networks, remember the proverb:
<li>"Fopen before sock, got it on lock, socket before fopen, students be mopin'" 
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Socket</h2>
<code>int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);</code>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Do you want to read all this (from man socket):
<code>       The  domain argument specifies a communication domain; this selects the 
       protocol family which will be used for communication.  These families are
       defined in <sys/socket.h>.  The formats currently understood by  the  Linux
       kernel include:

       Name         Purpose                                    Man page
       AF_UNIX      Local communication                        unix(7)
       AF_LOCAL     Synonym for AF_UNIX
       AF_INET      IPv4 Internet protocols                    ip(7)
       AF_AX25      Amateur radio AX.25 protocol               ax25(4)
       AF_IPX       IPX - Novell protocols
       AF_APPLETALK AppleTalk                                  ddp(7)
       AF_X25       ITU-T X.25 / ISO-8208 protocol             x25(7)
       AF_INET6     IPv6 Internet protocols                    ipv6(7)</code>
<li>Didn't think so (you can if you want).
<li>Rather than spend the next 4 weeks figuring out Amateur radio AX.25, we'll use this little thing called "the Internet".
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>INET</h2>
<code>int socket(AF_INET, int type, int protocol);</code>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Protocol (IP) addressing is a fundamental aspect of computer networking, providing a unique numerical identifier to each device connected to a network.</li>
  <li>These addresses enable data packets to be routed across the internet, ensuring communication between devices.
  <ul><li>My position: sockets are in scope, packets are out of scope.
  </ul>
  <li>IPv4, the original (???) version, uses 32-bit addresses.</li>
  <li>Quick: What is 2^32.
  <li>IPv4 addresses are typically written in dotted-decimal notation
  <ul><li>four octets separated by periods (dots).<li>Each octet represents a byte (8 bits) of the IPv4 address, ranging from 0 to 255.<li>For example, an IPv4 address might look like this: 192.168.1.1.
</section>

<section>
<h2>INET6</h2>
<code>int socket(AF_INET6, int type, int protocol);</code>

<ul>
  <li>We ran out of sauce so IPv6 was introduced in 1998 and became a standard in 2017, with a 128-bit format.
  <ul><li>The first three integers, famously, are NULL, 4, 6
  <li>Anyways, what is 2^128 / 2^32
  </ul>
  <li>IPv6 addresses are typically written in hexadecimal notation
  <ul><li>Eight groups of <li>Four hexadecimal digits (or nothing if all zero)<li>Separated by colons<li>For example: 2001:0db8::8a2e:0370:7334.</ul>
  <li>One of the greatest pleasures of my life is getting to teach IPv6 now after a rough few decades of teaching IPv4. I'm extremely grateful Willamette is on IPv6, and not using a protocol that was set to be phased out in December 1998 and has not been the internet standard since 14 July 2017.
  <code>user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ ping willamette.edu
PING willamette.edu (158.104.100.63) 56(84) bytes of data.</code>
<li>...
<li>I'm just gonna teach IPv6 and you can use it locally within device.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>SOCK_STREAM</h2>
<code>int socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, int protocol);</code>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Do you want to read all this (from man socket):
<code>        The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the communication
        semantics.  Currently defined types are:

       SOCK_STREAM     Provides  sequenced,  reliable,  two-way,  connection-based
	               byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism 
	               may be supported.

       SOCK_DGRAM      Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a 
	               fixed maximum length).

       SOCK_SEQPACKET  Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data 
	               transmission path for  datagrams of  fixed maximum length; a
	               consumer is required to read an entire packet with each input
	               system call.

       SOCK_RAW        Provides raw network protocol access.</code>
<li>Didn't think so (you can if you want).
<li>Rather than spend the next 4 weeks figuring out bitwise protocols, we'll use SOCK_STREAM.
</section>

<section>
<h2>SOCK_STREAM</h2>
<code>int socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, int protocol);</code>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>I think you do want to read all this:
<code class="lisp">Since Linux 2.6.27, the type argument serves a second purpose: in addition to specifying a socket type, it may include the bitwise OR of any of the following values, to modify the behavior of socket():

SOCK_NONBLOCK   Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the open file description (see 
                open(2)) referred to by w file descriptor.  Using this flag saves
                extra calls to fcntl(2) to  achieve  the  same result.
					   
SOCK_CLOEXEC    Set  the  close-on-exec  (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.
                See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why
                this may be useful.</code>
<li>SOCK_NONBLOCK is one way to do snek.
<li>The references to open() are simply intellectually interesting.
</section>

<section>
<h2>SOCK_STREAM</h2>
<code>int socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0) ;</code>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>I'll save you some reading, protocol is zero for IP, don't overthink it.
<li>Sockets are included in sys/socket.h
<li>INET6 is in arpa/inet.h

<code class="c">#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

#define DOMAIN AF_INET6

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	// set up variables
	int sock = socket(DOMAIN, SOCK_STREAM, 0);</code>
<li>Or at least, that's what I do.
<li>Apparently you're also supposed to include sys/types.h and use netinet/in.h instead of apra/inet.h - just test on your system.
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Struct sockaddr</h2>
	<p>
    <ul style="width:100%">
		<li>Okay here's the deal - network connects are (gasp) more complicated than files
		<li>So we can't just open a socket and hope it connects to *$ online ordering.
		<li>We use addresses - and need a bit more than just an IP address.
		<li>We need, in fact, whatever it is that is in a struct sockaddr.
		<li>Remember learning about structs? Good.
		<code>struct sockaddr {
	sa_family_t     sa_family;      /* Address family */
	char            sa_data[];      /* Socket address */
};</code>
<li>In practice, sockaddr is never used except for casting.
<li>IP uses sockaddr_in and sockaddr_in6 for INET and INET6 respectively.
<li>I'm teaching sockaddr_in6.
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Struct sockaddr_in6</h2>
	<p>By convention, I call my sockets "sock" or "socket" and my sockaddr_in6s "addr" or "address"
    <ul style="width:100%">
	<code>       struct sockaddr_in6 {
           sa_family_t     sin6_family;    /* AF_INET6 */
           in_port_t       sin6_port;      /* Port number */
           uint32_t        sin6_flowinfo;  /* IPv6 flow info */
           struct in6_addr sin6_addr;      /* IPv6 address */
           uint32_t        sin6_scope_id;  /* Set of interfaces for a scope */
       };

       struct in6_addr {
           uint8_t   s6_addr[16];
       };</code>
	<li>We care about family, port, and addr.
	<li>If you care about the other stuff, good for you. Look up sockaddr. Otherwise:<ul>
        <code>address.sin6_family = DOMAIN; // DOMAIN is INET6, define it or say INET6
address.sin6_port = htons(PORT);
SERVER: address.sin6_addr = in6addr_any;
CLIENT: inet_pton(DOMAIN, "::1", &address.sin6_addr);</code>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>SERVER and CLIENT</h2>
	<p>Wait what is this SERVER and CLIENT nonsense.
    <ul style="width:100%">
	<li>Right.
	<li>Okay so sockets are implemented using a server/client paradigm where...
	<li>First server does this:
	        <code>address.sin6_family = DOMAIN; // DOMAIN is INET6, define it or say INET6
address.sin6_port = htons(PORT);
address.sin6_addr = in6addr_any;</code>
	<li>Then another program does this:
	        <code>address.sin6_family = DOMAIN; // DOMAIN is INET6, define it or say INET6
address.sin6_port = htons(PORT);
inet_pton(DOMAIN, "::1", &address.sin6_addr);</code>
	<li>Then all the file-style readin' and writin' (and 'rithmetic) can happen.
</section>


<section>
    <h2>Endianness</h2>
	<p>Wait what is this htons and pton nonsense.
    <ul style="width:100%">
	<li>You'll love this.
	<li>Some computers like to put the 1s bit in first byte, and some put the 1s bit in the last byte (when storing numbers).
	<li>Easy to check, especially if you're ChatGPT (comments mine)
	<code>void main() {
    unsigned int x = 1;     // set 1s bit to 1, all others to 0, in a ~32 bit val
    char *c = (char*)&x;    // look at only the first 8 of the bits with a cast

    if (*c == 1) {
        printf("Little endian\n");  // the 1s bit is in the first 8
    } else {
        printf("Big endian\n");     // the 1s bit is not
    }
}</code>
	<li>Intel is little-endian (1s bit first)
	<li>Internet is big-endian (1s bit last)
	<li>Don't check your endianness, htons() forces to big-endian for the internet
	<li>Stands for "host to network short" and targets a uint16_t, which is the type of in_port_t (sin6_port).
</section>


<section>
    <h2>Endianness</h2>
	<p>pton is "pointer to network" and converts a string to a numeric value.
    <ul style="width:100%">
	<li>We pass pointers because we're dealing with something of variable length.
	<code>SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

       int inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);</code>
	<li>Easy enough in practice - specify INET(6), write an address, and give where it goes in the sockaddr_in6
	<code>inet_pton(DOMAIN, "::1", &address.sin6_addr);</code>
	   
	<li>"::1" is the IPv6 "loopback" address to network locally.
	<li>"127.0.0.1" for IPv4
	<li>Mostly matters for doing local networking, otherwise you have to find out where your server/client is.
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Review</h2>
    <ul style="width:100%">
	<li>Both
<code>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; 
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt; 

#define DOMAIN AF_INET6 
#define PORT 0xC271 // or whatever

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{ 
    int sock = socket(DOMAIN, SOCK_STREAM, 0); 
    struct sockaddr_in6 addr; 
    
    addr.sin6_family = DOMAIN; 
    addr.sin6_port = htons(PORT); 
</code>
	<li>I have my servers be ready for any address...
	<code>address.sin6_addr = in6addr_any;</code>
	<li>... and clients use loopback.
	<code>inet_pton(DOMAIN, "::1", &address.sin6_addr);</code>
