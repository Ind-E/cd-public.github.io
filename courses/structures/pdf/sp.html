<ol>
<li>Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.
<pre><code>unvs = [v for v in g.setv if v not init] # using a list instead of set</code></pre>
<li>Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. 
<pre><code>dsts = [(v, float('inf'), None) for v in g.setv if v not init] + (init, 0, None)</code></pre>
The tentative distance of a node v is the length of the shortest path discovered so far between the node v and the starting node. Since initially no path is known to any other vertex than the source itself (which is a path of length zero), all other tentative distances are initially set to infinity. Set the initial node as current.<pre><code>curr = init</code></pre>
<li>For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.
<pre><code>
# we look at every edge
for e in g.sete:
	# while look at an edge, we consider each *unvisited* vertex
	for v in unvs:
		# if the edge is incident on the current and some unvisited vertex
		if v in e.vrts and curr in e.vrts:
			tnts += [v,dist(curr)+e.cost]
			</code></pre>
Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. 
<pre><code>
# we look at every tentative distance
for v, d in tnts:
	for i in range(len(dsts)):
		v2, d2, _ = dsts[i] # vertex, distance, predecessor
		if v == v2 and d < d2:
			dsts[i] = (v, d, curr)
			</code></pre>

For example, if the current node Boise is marked with a distance of 25, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor Salt Lake City has length 5, then the distance to SLC through Boise will be 25 + 5 = 30. If Salt Lake City was previously marked with a distance greater than 30 then change it to 30. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.<br>
<li>When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.<pre><code>
unvs -= {curr}
			</code></pre></li>
<li>If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.<pre><code>
if unvs == set():
	return dsts
			</code></pre></li></li>
<li>Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new current node, and go back to step 3.
<pre><code>
curr = #something in unvs
			</code></pre></li></li></li>
</ol>
