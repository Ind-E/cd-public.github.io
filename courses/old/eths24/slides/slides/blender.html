<h2>Today</h2>
<h3>But First</h3>
<p>Today's theme is "Knowledge into Action"
<p><pre><code>Blender is licensed as GNU GPL, owned by its contributors.
For that reason Blender is Free and Open Source software, forever.</pre></code></p>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://www.blender.org/">https://www.blender.org/</a> either individually or in a group. <i>Probably a good day for groups</i>
<p>I expect you have room on your device to download Blender from the download links on this website.
<p>It will take a moment to download and install, but shouldn't be too bad.
<h3>Why Blender</h3>
<p>A few months ago, a colleague in game industry shared this article with me: <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/code-my-crown-guide-released-for-black-hairstyles-in-games">https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/code-my-crown-guide-released-for-black-hairstyles-in-games</a>
<p>Take a few minutes to read over the article and reflect on it in the context of the Kinda Funny.
<p>The last line of the article includes a link to the following webpage: <a href="https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/campaigns/code-my-crown.html">Code My Crown</a>. I guess I missed this whole thing was put together by Dove, so I did a bit of a double take when I landed there, but scroll down a bit and there's a link called "Download the guide".
<h3>The Guide</h3>
<p>Once you have the guide downloaded, review pages 3-14. I hope you find them informative!
<p>Separately, review 15-17 and keep these in mind, you may be back latter.
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>Dove US and code-my-crown maintains a GitHub repository that to the best of my understanding is free and open-source. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/dove-us/code-my-crown/">here</a>.
<p>For many hairstyles, there's a /Files/3D/filename.fbx file in the repository that can be imported to Blender.
<p>For all hairstyles, there are user guides within the PDF guide.
<h3>The Ask</h3>
<p>Identify one or several hairstyles and with a combination of trial and error, the PDF guide, the answer key, and good old fashioned search engines, play around about with using Blender to get an understanding of the problem space.
<p>Your own analysis or you place within the US racial caste system may cause you to feel strange about engaging with this data set for any number of reasons. If you do feel that way, interrogate you own feelings to in light of the materials we have surveyed for this class. You may wish to consider other blender targets. For example, my ancestors probably used hairstyles best captured by traditional festivals documented by the Durbrovnik Times <a href="https://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/news/dubrovnik/item/2197-photo-gallery-traditional-hairstyles-of-dubrovnik-region">here</a> or by Albrecht Dürer in images preserved here <a href="http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/08/16th-century-irish-hipsters/">here</a>. Given my level of training in Blender, if I'm going to do a bad job with something I may want to do it to these hairstyles until I feel more comfortable in Blender. On the other hand, perhaps I should get over myself. Think about it and make up your own mind! I'm not going to tell you how to feel.
<h3>The Deliverable</h3>
<p>For class today, I am asking you to mock up a quick page, like this one, that should include a few things. What follows is an example, though I would like to see some screenshots from you as well.
<p>For instance, I was really impressed with Code My Crown just as a cultural artifact. I hadn't thought a lot about what a serious cultural preservation and popularization effort would look like for hairstyles, and I think it's very cool that a cultural production like this emerged from computing.
<p>I was shocked with availability of Blender. I'd heard of Blender before and vaguely knew what it was, but I had never thought to just go and see if I could download it, much less find assets online I could in Blender and try to learn the tool while studying the artwork. That was really neat!
<p>I found Blender quite challenging to use just in terms of my ability to control a mouse and keyboard setup. I think a lot of digital arts have some sort of stylus they use or something to that effective, if they don't simply work on touchscreen, and I see why they do that. The sheer volume of options in Blender was also, of course, overwhelming, but no more than expected having used image and video editting software. It is, afterall, 3D!
<p>Despite these challenges, compared to some of the models I've seen games and film, I don't think it's reasonable to have such an artistic shortfall in Black hairstyles. Sure, making good art is hard, but when that difficult is a barrier to depicting some cultures but not others, it feels worse than negligent, at least to me.
<p>I tried to make the "Low Ponytail with Swoop Bang" because it looked like it only used Blender and I thought I might have a chance. That was this style:
<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dove-us/code-my-crown/main/H_LowPonytail_Swoop_Bang/Files/Render/LowPonytailSwoopBang_03.jpg">
<p>I would encourage posting some screenshots of messing around with Blender and some notes. For instance, I mostly played around with "radius" and "strength" on the default tool when trying to recreate this hairstyle, and that was about as far as I got. I also found some documentation for other hairstyles, such as the "Hair System Geometry Nodes" found <a href="https://ninodefoq.gumroad.com/l/hairgeometrynodes">here</a>.
<p>Reflecting on what I've seen in media, I think the sharpest constrast for me was the built-in support in Elden Ring for the Draconian pre-set. 
<img width="100%" src="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/draconian_base_templates_elden_ring_wiki_175px.png">
<p>The pre-sets dance around calling themselves "race" or "ethnicity" but include options such as "Northerner", "Seafarer", or "Reedlander" that feel conspiciously based on actually existing cultures. The care and thought put into Draconian character creation, an extremely made-up preset, and the lack of care and thought into Black hairstyles and cultures, feels extremely sharp and disappointing.
<p>I feel I would be remiss to make no mention of gender as well, after a lengthy discussion of race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture. Carolyn Petit was front-line gender scholar and journalist during the worst times of Gamergate, and highlighted what I'll call a "gender" slider in character creation for Dark Souls 2. I don't usually get to make characters that feel like me for a variety of reasons, but I remember that slider quite clearly.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dark Souls II&#39;s &quot;adjust hormones&quot; option. Drangleic is a grim world but HRT is covered by the health care plan. <a href="http://t.co/NeAVWsnMdw">pic.twitter.com/NeAVWsnMdw</a></p>&mdash; Carolyn Petit (@carolynmichelle) <a href="https://twitter.com/carolynmichelle/status/454845411480444929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
<p>That I remember this so well suggests strongly to me that having options for people to see themselves depicted in character design is an imperative for truly excellent art in this medium, and I am excited to see what the future holds and if there's any way I, as a computing professional, can support these efforts.
