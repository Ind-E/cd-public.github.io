<h4>Textbook</h4>
Much of this course will reference extensive online materials. However, you may prefer having a textbook available as well.
There is no required textbook, but I recommend the following as a reference:
<br/><br/>
Computer Security: Principles and Practice, 3rd Edition by Stallings and Brown<br/>
ISBN: 9780133773927
<br/><br/>
I am happy to help you access textbooks, just ask!

<h4>Assignments</h4>
Assignment submission is to be determined, but likely via e-mail to <a href="mailto:ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu">ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu</a>.<br/>

<h4>Piazza</h4>
Piazza
is the best place for you to ask your questions. 
Students enrolled in the class will be added to the Piazza just prior 
to the first day of class. Here are some guidelines.
<ul>
<li>If you are wondering about something, ask a question!</li>
<li>Answer other students' questions and refine existing answers.</li>
<li>Be polite; be kind.</li>
<li>Do not post code or ask others to post code.</li>
<li>You may post privately to me, but I reserve the right to make all or part of the post public if I feel the question is of general interest to the class. (If I do this, I will anonymize the post.)</li>
<li>I may post questions on Piazza that get emailed to me if I feel the question is of general interest to the class. (Same as above.)</li>
