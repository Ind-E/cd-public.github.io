    <h2>First: Allocative Harm</h2>
    <p>"...a woman is offered a lower credit limit than her husband despite a shared financial history"</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discrete</li>
        <li>Transactional</li>
        <li>Quantifiable</li>

    <p>Basically defeated with the lines we used for <em>Omelas</em>, just formalized up for academic writing (e.g. no Applebees)</p>

    <h2>Zeroth: Representational Harms</h2>
    <p>"translate “she is a doctor”  into a gender neutral
language and then [back] producing “he is a doctor”"</p>

        <li>Long-term</li>
        <li>Diffuse</li>
        <li>"Upstream"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider the biases in sourcing the AI & Access readings.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Thesis (I think)</h2>
    <p>"...identifying the root causes of algorithmic harms is
essential to ensuring that changes to sociotechnical systems address problems at their source..."</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The authors argue the root causes are cognitive (epistemological).</li>
        <li>For <em>Omelas</em> I argued they were material</li>
        <li>This distinction is out-of-scope/up-to-you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do our thoughts determine our realities or our realities determine our thoughts?</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>"A New Epistemic Lens"</h2>
    <p>"...distinguish between two distinct epistemic contexts
relevant to analyzing and addressing algorithmic harms through
three categories of interventions..."</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigation</li>
        <li>Substantiation</li>
        <li>Amelioration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may (???) claim HUD failed amelioration due to lacking an epistemic (or materialist) lens.</p>

    <p>Miranda Fricker, NYU Philosophy identifies: </p>

citizens"</li>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>An editorial note:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I felt the authors advanced an explicitly epistemology-first line</li>
		<li>A disjointed and contradictory section appears added latter
        <li>All citations of self-described Black feminists are in this section and only citations of self-described Black feminists are in this section (iff)
		<li>This section advances the notion of the centrality of materialism
	</ul>
	<p>This piece is relatively successful in inclusive citation, but these citations and their context enhance rather than assuage my surprise at the initial treatment of epistemology as a root cause.

    <h2>Allocative Harms</h2>
	<p>"Concerns have also been raised with respect to Facebook’s “spe-
cial ad audience” tool, which uses a machine learning algorithm
to identify users who are similar to a class of users selected by an
advertiser such as its existing workforce"
    <ul>
        <li>See also: Amazon “penalize resumes that included the word ‘women’s,”</li>

    <h2>Harmful Representations in Algorithmic
Systems</h2>
	<p>"Applying the epistemic lens to cases where something has gone
wrong within an algorithmic system can help clarify the social
impact of these classifications, as well as the root causes of the
harms often described as representational."
    <ul>
        <li>Misrepresentation (stereotyping)</li>
        <li>Misidentification (mislabelling)</li>
