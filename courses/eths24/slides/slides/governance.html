    <h2>Data Governance</h2>
    <p>We are 1-2 lecture short by my count.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data governance comes up a lot...</li>
        <li>Hard to find edu treatments of it outside of e.g. DataCamp</li>
        <li>VERY common when talking about cloud computing / data cloud</li>
        <li>I am carrying out some cloud efforts unrelated to this class so...</li>
        <li>Today: Data governance as Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud player, understands it.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>Amazon like this. <em>Calvin like this.</em>

<section>
    <h2>Data Governance?</h2>
    <p>Data governance is a methodology that ensures data is in the proper condition to support business initiatives and operations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Justify funding for the data governance program</li>
        <li>Motivate participation by the business communities</li>
        <li>Drive the priority of data governance activities</li>
        <li>Drive the level of data integration required across participating business areas</li>
        <li>Help to determine the right operating model, especially the level of centralization and decentralization required</li>
    </ul>
	<p><em>How do you feel about data governance being considered part of data science? Is supporting business the responsibility of data scientists? Who benefits from this expectation?</em>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Analytics Governance</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Analytics governance involves governing data for use in analytic applications and usage of analytics systems.</li>
    <li>The analytics governance team can establish governance mechanisms, such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics report versioning.</li>
        <li>Documentation standards.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>It is essential to:
    <ul>
        <li>Keep track of regulatory requirements.</li>
        <li>Establish company policies regarding analytics usage.</li>
        <li>Provide guardrails to ensure compliance across the organization.</li>
    </ul></li></ul>
	<p><em>Who benefits from analytics governance?</em>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>According to <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2021/01/12/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2021/">Gartner</a>, by 2025, 80% of organizations aiming to scale digital business may fail due to inadequate modern data and analytics governance.</li>
    <li>Chief Data Officers (CDOs) regard data governance as a top priority for their initiatives.</li>
    <li>In a 2023 survey by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data/cdo-report/">MIT CDOIQ</a>, 45% of Chief Data Officers identified data governance as a critical concern.</li>
    <li>Data leaders aim to establish a governance model ensuring:
    <ul>
        <li>Timely availability of data to the right people and applications.</li>
        <li>Data security and safety with appropriate controls.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Machine Learning (ML) Governance</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>ML governance applies data governance practices to ML, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring data quality and integration for model training and deployment.</li>
        <li>Responsible AI usage, especially concerning sensitive data.</li>
        <li>Enabling participation in model building, deployment, and monitoring.</li>
        <li>Documenting model training, versioning, supported use cases, and ethical guidelines.</li>
        <li>Monitoring models in production for accuracy and potential issues like drift, overfitting, and underfitting.</li>
    </ul></ul>
	<p><em>I think this definition leaves out the most important factor - do you think something or things are missing?</em>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Main Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The strategic challenge for data governance is aligning the program with business initiatives:
    <ul>
        <li>Directly proposing the value of data governance can be ineffective.</li>
        <li>Position data governance to support business initiatives.</li>
        <li>Ensure data is in the right condition to support business success.</li>
        <li>Do not overlook reporting and auditing practices for supporting initiatives.</li>
    </ul></ul>
	<p><em>Should data serve business or some other entity or goal?</em>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Styles of Data Governance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Centralized data governance</b>: <ul>
        <li>Centralize responsiblity for mission statements, policies, tool choices, and more. <li>The day-to-day actions are many times pushed into lines of business (LOB).</li></ul>
        <li><b>Federated data governance</b>: <ul><li>Individual business units operate in the way that best matches their needs. <li>A smaller centralized team which focuses their work on solving common problems, like making data quality tools.</li></ul>
        <li><b>Decentralized data governance</b>: <ul>
        <li>Each LOB does what they need for their specific project. <li>Each project freely uses any tools or processes from other projects. <li>As approaches data mesh (2019-) increase in popularity, so does decentralized..</li>
    </ul>
	<p><em>What sounds good to you personally? What do you think works well for Willamette? Intel? Dutch Bros.?</em></p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Who Builds Data Governance?</h2>
    <p>Building a business-centric data governance program requires many job functions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Executives</b> control funding to determine priorities for data governance support.</li>
        <li><b>Data stewards</b> monitor details of projects day to day. They elevate irregularities up to executives.</li>
        <li><b>Data owners</b> make policies about the data, including who should have access to the data and under what circumstances, how to interpret and apply regulations, and key term definitions</li>
        <li><b>Data engineers</b> are computing specialists, and provide tools that help secure data, manage data quality, integrate data from a variety of sources, and find the right data.</li>
    </ul>
	<p><em>Data scientists can be any of these roles. Who does this leave out?</em></p>
</section>

	<p>Wait that's just basic non-data / non-cloud cybersecurity from 1977.
</section>

<section>
        <h2>The "CIA" Triad</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Confidentiality</li>
            <li>Integrity</li>
            <li>Availability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Introduced in "Post Processing Audit Tools and Techniques in 1977.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nbsspecialpublication500-19.pdf">link</a>
			<li>Go to page 11-3
			<li>Alternatively, search "confidentiality".
			<pre><code class="lisp">OBJECTIVES OF A TYPICAL SECURITY AUDIT
The post processing activities of the auditor are presented here in the context of a security audit and include confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.</pre></code>

    </section>
	

    <section>
        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The system must not disclose any information intended to be hidden</li>
            <li>E.g. credit card information on a website</li>
            <li>E.g. status of your accounts (to an unauthorized user)</li>
            <li>Beware of indirect disclosure
                <ul>
                    <li>Error messages can give away 'too much' information!</li>
                    <li>Info dumps when a page fails, or app fails</li>
                    <li>Login failures</li>
                    <li>URL query strings can tell you about internal data</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think: is <b>open source software</b> likely to be more or less confidential?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The system must not allow assets to be subverted by unauthorized users</li>
            <li>E.g. changing a student’s academic status</li>
            <li>We must be able trust what is in the system
                <ul>
                    <li>The data being stored</li>
                    <li>The functionality being executed</li>
					<li>NOTE: Under the von Neumann model these are both just <b>DATA</b>
                </ul>
			
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think: what makes us willing to trust (1) something on the internet or (2) an email?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The system must be able to be available and operational to users</li>
            <li>E.g. bringing down Amazon.com</li>
            <li>These are extremely hard to protect against</li>
            <li>Any system performance degradation that can be triggered by a user can be used for denial of service attacks</li>
            <li>Concurrency issues, infinite loop, or resource exhaustion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think: when was the last time Facebook was down? Netflix? Healthcare.gov?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Auditability or Nonrepudiation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>An actor should not be able to deny or dispute their actions</li>
            <li>E.g. instructors allowing cheat sheet usage on exam</li>
            <li>A party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, and the other party cannot deny having sent the transaction</li>
        </ul>
		<p>My assessment: Out of scope for this class beyond this mention.
    </section>
	
	<section>
    <h2>So what?</h2>
    <p>Well data governance gives us a framework to assess e.g. a network outage. <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/forum/pdf/data_governance_checklist.pdf">rip</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>What is the structure for effective data management</li>
    <li>What are policies for data quality and security</li>
    <li>What is sensitive data to target security efforts</li>
    <li>How to manages data content to justify collection</li>
    <li>What are procedures for handling data</li>
    <li>How to ensure data accuracy, relevance, and completeness through proactive governance</li>
    <li>Who determines levels of access based on roles and responsibilities</li>
    <li>How to mitigates risks of data breaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a minute and discuss in the context of Willamette or your favorite cyberdisaster!
