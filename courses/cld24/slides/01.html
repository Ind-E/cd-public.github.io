<h2>Background</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Thesis Title</dt>
<dd>Mining Secure Behavior of Hardware Designs
</dd>
<dt>Plain English</dt>
<dd>Just as there are bugs in code that makes <b>software</b>, modern <b>hardware</b> is also written in code and therefore may contain bugs. I find these bugs.
</dd>
<dt>Thesis</dt>
<dd>Specification mining can discover properties that can be used to verify the secure
behavior of closed source CISC CPU designs, properties that can be used to verify
the temporal correctness of CPU designs, and hyperproperties that can be used to
verify that modules, SoCs, and CPUs have secure information flow.

<h2>Background</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Research Cloud Computing</dt>
<dd>Mining Secure Behavior of Hardware Designs is hard/slow.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://cd-public.github.io/papers/2021/ASHES2021.pdf">Reference text</a></dt>
<dd>When parallelizing all
trace generation and all case mining, Isadora could theoretically
evaluate the Single ACW case fully in less than five minutes. Parallelizing the first phase requires a Radix-S and QuestaSim instance
for each source register, and each trace is generated in approximately 100 seconds. Further, the trace generation time is dominated
by write-to-disk, and performance engineering techniques could
likely reduce it significantly, such as by changing trace encoding
or piping directly to later phases. Parallelizing the second phase
requires only a Python instance for each source register, and takes
between 1 and 2 seconds per trace. Parallelizing the third phase
requires a Daikon instance for each flow case, usually roughly the
same number as unique sources, and takes between 10 and 30 seconds per flow case. The final phase, postprocessing, is also suitable
for parallelization. Maximally parallelized, this gives a design-to-specification time of under four minutes for the single ACW and
for similarly sized designs, including PicoRV32.
</dd>
<dt>Plain text</dt>
<dd>Rather than do 100s of things for 3 minutes to take 100s of minutes, we can use 100s of computers for 3 minutes and always be done in 3 minutes.

<h2>Motivations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of solving hard problems, we use more computers</li>
<li>Computers are cheap, and people that can use them well are expensive</li>
<li>In my experience: your boss/manager/accountability group always want you to spend $0.12 to use the 1000s of the fastest computers on earth for 5 seconds, rather than 6 months writing "better" code.
<ul>
<li>Writing fast code is hard, and spending $0.12 is easy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="block" name="Primary Objective">
<p>To be conversant and comfortable under the cloud computing paradigm.</p>
</div>
<p>Doing so will require that students be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a high level understanding of MapReduce and its descendents</li>
<li>Use cloud technologies, like Spark (really we only need Spark)<ul>
<li>The course description said Hadoop, it meant Spark (sorry)</ul>
<li>Work with back-end web technologies, like Node.js/Flask<ul>
<li>Flask is lightweight Python web programming, Node is a ✨new language✨ (JavaScript)</ul>
<li>Deploy jobs to cloud services, including Azure and GCP (AWS is less edu friendly)</li>
<li>Stretch goal: Work with the "data cloud": BigQuery and Databricks (Snowflake is less edu friendly)</li>
<li>Have a tasteful (e.g. not excessive) amount of fun</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cloud computing classes are inherently experimental due to rapidly changing technologies.</li>
<li>My plan is to give some lectures and assignments and just assume we all do well.
<li>There are no planned tests, and there's a potential final project (depending on whether things keep working for 14 weeks) that's more portfolio than grade motivated.
<li>My grade plan is "show up + good faith effort on homeworks = A"<ul>
<li>If you want to know how you are doing, I will provide narrative (that is, not quantitative) feedback by request.<li>This will let you know, for example, what I would be able to write on a letter of recommendation.<li>My opinion: You should be more letter motivated than grade motivated this semester.
</ul>
</section>
<section class="present" style="display: block;">
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check your email for a link to Discord
<img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/6257adef93867e50d84d30e2/636e0b5061df29d55a92d945_full_logo_blurple_RGB.svg">
</li><li>Post code to Discord as follows - I am a screenshot-hater, please do not make me retype your code!
<ul><li>Drag-and-drop or use the (+) button to share the file(s).
<ul><li>Once you are confused, you are unlikely to guess where the problem is coming from in a larger file.</li></ul>
</li><li>Share code snippets using triple quotes and a language. <code class="hljs awk">'''Python
def fibonacci(n):
     if n in [0,1]:
             return n
     return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
'''</code>

<h2>Diving In</h2>
<ul>
<li>This course is an introduction on <em>security</em>, and covers more than just programming!</li>
<li>Programming will be used to teach the computing portion of the course, but the focus is less on programming itself and more on general computer ssecurity principles.</li>
<li>If you come across situations where you need to know a bit more about specific programming details, there are plenty of resources online, or just ask me!</li>
</ul>

    <h2>WHY CALL IT THE "CLOUD"?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Computing happens somewhere else, not on your PC or mobile device
            <ul>
                <li>A big goal is to prepare students for careers at the companies building and running the cloud (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook…).</li>
                <li>Cloud computing is a technology course: we ask how things really work, not a concepts course that might be more centered on capabilities and use cases (in fact we will see lots of those, but they aren’t our main topic)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Cloud Underpins Modern Computing
            <ul>
                <li>Physical:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cloud is a global deployment of massive data centers connected by ultra-fast networking, designed for scalability and robustness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Logical:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A collection of tools and platforms that scale amazingly well. The platforms matter most; as a developer, they allow you to extend/customize them to create your application as a “personality” over their capabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Conceptual:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A set of scalable ideas, concepts, and design strategies.</li>
                    </ul>

    <h2>WHO INVENTED THE CLOUD?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My view: it emerged naturally from high quality systems programming.
            <ul>
                <li>As computer chips got faster, they hit a "heat wall" where they couldn't speed up without melting.</li>
                <li>To get past the heatwall, Intel et al. placed multiple processing units on a single chip (e.g. Phone/Tablet/PC).</li>
				<li>To use multiply processing units, sometimes <i>n</i> pieces of code had to run at the same time.
				<li>If <i>n</i> can be 8 (my phone) why not 10^6 (my phone's app's datacenters)
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>WHO INVENTED THE CLOUD?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Another view: It emerged naturally from the Internet
            <ul>
                <li>The internet runs over networks between multiple computers with different computing and data capabilities.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If I can ask Google for directions, why can't I ask Google to compute a mean
                        <li>If Google can ask me for a password, why can't it ask me for a .csv
                        <li>If computing is already distributed across local and remote servers, why not write code for this paradigm.
                    </ul>
                </li>

<section>
    <h2>WHO INVENTED THE CLOUD?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My view: It DID NOT emerge from "classical" software engineering
            <ul>
                <li>"Object oriented languages" e.g. Java won the software engineering wars of the 00s.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am a hater.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Functional programming e.g. R couldn't keep up.</li>
                <li>MapReduce, two functions, unseated Objects as the dominate paradigm over time</li>

    <h2>CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>DATA 599 is…
            <ul>
                <li>A whirlwind of a big topic.</li>
                <li>In spring 2021 one focus will be on “smart farming” in Azure IoT Edge.</li>
                <li>The farming focus leverages a Cornell and Microsoft interest (and an Azure product area) and makes it real.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>EVERYTHING IS BIG IN THE CLOUD</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data in the cloud
            <ul>
                <li>1 Exabyte of data is 1,073,741,824 GB. (Your hard disk probably holds 64GB, but is way too slow by data-center standards)</li>
                <li>The Internet has about 2B websites, and of these, 644M have “active content”</li>
                <li>… and all of this is “pre Internet of Things”</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>IOT AT THE EDGE: THE BIG NEW THING</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Our course looks at many aspects of the cloud but will focus on live interactions with the outside world.</li>
        <li>This used to be dominated by web interfaces, but increasingly also includes 5G mobility and a wide variety of Internet of Things sensors and actuators: the so-called IoT cloud.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>CONCEPT: DIGITAL TWIN</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We often like to think of the cloud as having a software “image” that matches with IoT in the physical world.</li>
        <li>The IoT devices are physical and live “outside” the cloud, but for each device we have a “digital twin” that lives inside the cloud, and is a kind of proxy. Actions on the twin are translated to reading the sensor or telling the actuator to do something.</li>
        <li>This model will be very useful to us in CS5412</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>HOW DID TODAY’S CLOUD EVOLVE?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prior to ~2005, we had “data centers designed for high availability”.</li>
        <li>Amazon had especially large ones, to serve its web requests</li>
        <li>This is all before the AWS cloud model</li>
        <li>The real goal was just to support online shopping</li>
        <li>Their system wasn’t very reliable, and the core problem was scaling</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>WASN’T GOOGLE FIRST?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Google was still building their first scalable infrastructure in this period.</li>
        <li>Because Amazon ran into scaling issues first, Google (a bit later) managed to avoid them.
            <ul>
                <li>In some sense, Amazon dealt with these issues “in real time”.</li>
                <li>Google had a chance to build a second system by learning from Amazon’s mistakes and approaches.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>YAHOO EXPERIMENT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the 2005 time period everyone was talking about an experiment done at Yahoo. It was an “alpha/beta” experiment about ad-click-through</li>
        <li>Customers who saw web page rendering faster than 100ms clicked ads.</li>
        <li>For every 100ms delay, click-through rates noticeably dropped.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>MORE YAHOO FINDINGS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rending the ads first didn’t help – in fact it hurt.</li>
        <li>Customers wanted to see the “real content” first.</li>
        <li>Rendering the ads after the content hurt too.</li>
        <li>To get the best click-through rates, render your pages (ads included) fast!</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>EVERYONE HEARD THIS MESSAGE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At Amazon, Jeff Bezos spread the word internally.</li>
        <li>He wanted Amazon to win this sprint.</li>
        <li>The whole company was told to focus on ensuring that every Amazon product page would render with minimal delay. Unfortunately… as more and more customers turned up… Amazon’s web pages slowed down. This is a “crisis of the commons” situation.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>THE CRISIS OF THE COMMONS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At the center of the village is a lovely grassy commons. Everyone uses it.</li>
        <li>One day a farmer has an awesome idea. He lets his goats graze on the commons. This saves the time of herding them to his fields. This gains him hours that he uses to improve his goat cheese factory.</li>
        <li>He earns extra money with his award-winning cheeses.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>WHERE ARE THE COMMONS, IN A CLOUD?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the cloud we need to think about all the internal databases and services “shared” by lots and lots of -service instances.</li>
        <li>If we take the advice to “make everything as fast as possible”, all those millions of first-tier -services will be greedy.</li>
        <li>But what works best for one instance, all by itself, might overload the shared services when the same code runs side by side with huge numbers of other instances (“when we run at scale”)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>THE CLOUD AND THE “THUNDERING HERD”</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In fact this is a very common pattern.</li>
        <li>Something becomes successful at small scale, so everyone wants to try it.</li>
        <li>But now the same code patterns that worked at small scale might break. The key to scalability in a cloud is to use the cloud platform in a smart way.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>STARTING AROUND 2006, AMAZON LED IN REINVENTING DATA CENTER COMPUTING</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Amazon reorganized their whole approach:
            <ul>
                <li>Requests arrived at a “first tier” of very lightweight servers.</li>
                <li>These dispatched work requests on a message bus or queue.</li>
                <li>The requests were selected by “micro-services” running in elastic pools.</li>
                <li>One web request might involve tens or hundreds of -services!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>They also began to guess at your next action and precompute what they would probably need to answer your next query or link click.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>TIER ONE / TIER TWO</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We often talk about the cloud as a “multi-tier” environment.</li>
        <li>Tier one: programs that generate the web page you see.</li>
        <li>Tier two: services that support tier one. We will see one later (DHT/KVS storage used to create a massive cache)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>TODAY’S CLOUD</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tier one runs on very lightweight servers:
            <ul>
                <li>They use very small amounts of computer memory</li>
                <li>They don’t need a lot of compute power either</li>
                <li>They have limited needs for storage, or network I/O</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tier two -Services specialize in various aspects of the content delivered to the end-user. They may run on somewhat “beefier” computers.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>THE CLOUD SCHEDULER</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The cloud scheduler watched each -service pool (each is shown as one dot, with color telling us how long the task queue was, and the purple circle showing how CPU loaded it is).</li>
        <li>The picture didn’t show how many instances were active – that makes it too hard to render. But each pool had varying numbers of instances. The App Server was automatically creating and removing instances.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO “ADD INSTANCES”?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For some applications (ones with NUMA threading for parallelism) we add instances by launching new threads on additional cores.</li>
        <li>For others, we literally run two or more identical copies of the same program, on different computers! They use a “load balancer” to send requests to the least loaded instances.</li>
        <li>And you can even combine these models…</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>WHY POOLS OF INSTANCES?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is really just one of a few ways to get parallelism</li>
        <li>Let’s look at some of the choices and try to understand why the cloud favors the approach we just saw on the Delimitrou visualization.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>HOW DO CLOUD SERVICES SCALE?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We’ve been acting as if each -service is a set of “processes” but ignoring how those processes were built.</li>
        <li>In fact, they will use parallel programming of some form because modern computers have NUMA architectures.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>OLD DEBATE: HOW TO LEVERAGE PARALLELISM?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Not every way of scaling is equally effective. Pick poorly and you might make less money!</li>
        <li>To see this, we’ll spend a minute on just one example.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>EXAMPLE: CLOUD HOSTED MUSIC SERVICE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Which would you pick?</li>
        <li>Basically, we have four options:
            <ul>
                <li>Keep my server busy by running one multithreaded application on it</li>
                <li>Keep it busy by running N unthreaded versions of my application as virtual machines, sharing the hardware</li>
                <li>Keep it busy by running N side by side processes, but don’t virtualize</li>
                <li>Keep it busy by running N side by side processes using containers</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>THE WINNER IS…</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Best is “container virtualization” with one server process dedicated to each distinct user.</li>
        <li>A single cloud server might host hundreds of these servers. But they are easy to build: you create one music player, and then tell the cloud to run as many “instances” as required</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>PAAS CONCEPT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The cloud favors PaaS.</li>
        <li>Basically, the vendor offers all the standard code, pre-built. They create the platform in ways that perform and scale really well.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>THOUGHT QUESTION</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Can you think of a few other “uses” for a platform that would support video on demand, but really uses a lambda for the playback function?</li>
        <li>Which parts would the platform be handling? How fancy can a lambda really be?</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>MORE TOPICS WE WILL TALK ABOUT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Azure’s IoT Edge
            <ul>
                <li>Sensors and actuators: what are they?</li>
                <li>How are digital twin solutions used?</li>
                <li>How do you customize an IoT cloud?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Filtering and transforming streaming data</li>
        <li>Fault Tolerance and Consistency
            <ul>
                <li>Challenges of dealing with real-time data</li>
                <li>Time synchronization, temporal storage</li>
                <li>Concepts of consistency for the cloud edge</li>

    <h2>EVERYONE NEEDS TO DO A PROJECT!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can work alone, or in teams. We encourage teaming, either with people you already know, or through “looking for teammates” on Piazza.</li>
        <li>We can also help you form a team if you don’t know anyone.</li>
        <li>Teams can accomplish more, and some team projects even become startups</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>PROJECT TOPICS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are welcome to invent one of your own, but it has to be a really good fit for cloud computing and not just some random computing project.</li>
        <li>These projects span a range of topics
            <ul>
                <li>Big data + AI tools, but with some form of streaming input.</li>
                <li>New cloud technologies layered on Cornell’s Cascade platform</li>
                <li>Proof of concept for your exciting web-hosted startup concept.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>CS5999 (MENG PROJECT CREDITS)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some people enlarge their CS5412 projects with our permission, based on a second, “parallel” investigation</li>
        <li>The 5999 project can’t be just “writing more code”. It has to be a significant design, performance, or user studies issue</li>
        <li>The goal is to push the envelope further on your main topic</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>EXTRA CREDIT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We often have small “quizzes” to see how well you are understanding the material</li>
        <li>Each week, there might be a “short assignment”</li>
        <li>We also have some “contest problems”</li>
        <li>The cloud favors PaaS.</li>
        <li>Basically, the vendor offers all the standard code, pre-built. They create the platform in ways that perform and scale really well.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>IN-PERSON PRELIM AND FINAL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Because of Cornell rules, you must come to campus to take these.</li>
        <li>Yes, you can take these remotely if you need to</li>
        <li>However, you will have to take an “off hours” exam which might be more stressful</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>FINAL GRADE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Projects are very important, and count more than anything else.</li>
        <li>Attendance is not taken, but don’t expect to do well if you don’t show up!</li>
        <li>There will be some extra credit available too</li>
        <li>Finally, exams aren’t intended to be difficult</li>
