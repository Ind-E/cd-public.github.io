# Podman

- `podman` is a command, like `python`
  - Like `python` we can provide arguments
  - Unlike `python` we provide further commands, not just a .py file
  
```bash
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman
Manage pods, containers and images

Usage:
  podman [options] [command]

Available Commands:
  attach      Attach to a running container
  build       Build an image using instructions from Containerfiles
```

# Run

- First thing we'll do in Podman is `run`
- So we do:
```bash
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman run
Error: requires at least 1 arg(s), only received 0
```

# Images

- The thing we run is called an image
- We'll use a sample image named Python
  - You'll never guess what it does (Python)
  
```bash
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman run python
Resolved "python" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/000-shortnames.conf)

Writing manifest to image destination

C:\Users\cd-desk>
```

# Just do -it

- We downloaded and ran an image but...
  - We didn't ask the image to do anything
  - So it exits instantly
- `run -it` for "interactive terminal"

```bash
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman run -it python

- This is a fun trick for people to lazy too update their local Python version (me)
